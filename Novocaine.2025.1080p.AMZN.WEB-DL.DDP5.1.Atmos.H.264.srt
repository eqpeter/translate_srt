1
00:01:25,352 --> 00:01:28,255
<i>And folks, if I've</i>
<i>learned one thing, it's this:</i>

2
00:01:28,388 --> 00:01:30,792
<i>You can't let your disability</i>
<i>hold you back.</i>

3
00:01:30,925 --> 00:01:33,160
<i>You got to wear it</i>
<i>like a badge of honor.</i>

4
00:01:33,293 --> 00:01:35,063
<i>You got to go out there</i>
<i>and you gotta say,</i>

5
00:01:35,195 --> 00:01:37,832
<i>"World, this is me.</i>
<i>This is who I am</i>
<i>in all my glory,</i>

6
00:01:37,966 --> 00:01:39,067
<i>and I'm here to win."</i>

7
00:02:20,775 --> 00:02:23,276
<i>Here at</i>
<i>San Diego Trust Credit Union,</i>

8
00:02:23,410 --> 00:02:24,946
<i>we don't have customers</i>

9
00:02:25,079 --> 00:02:28,248
or clients. We have members.

10
00:02:28,382 --> 00:02:30,685
Family members.

11
00:02:30,818 --> 00:02:31,886
And that's...

12
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:33,253
exciting!

13
00:02:35,222 --> 00:02:36,924
Yeah, big time.
Yes! Yeah.

14
00:02:37,058 --> 00:02:38,660
And there's nothing

15
00:02:38,793 --> 00:02:42,063
more exciting than
Christmas bonus day.

16
00:02:42,195 --> 00:02:44,065
Our busiest day of the year.

17
00:02:44,197 --> 00:02:46,100
The day hard-working
union members

18
00:02:46,233 --> 00:02:49,269
get to turn their labor
into holiday joy.

19
00:03:00,748 --> 00:03:03,685
Because tomorrow,
we put the "trust"

20
00:03:03,818 --> 00:03:05,687
in San Diego Trust.

21
00:03:06,621 --> 00:03:08,923
And that's it.
All right, that's it.

22
00:03:09,057 --> 00:03:11,092
Nice. Powerful.

23
00:03:11,224 --> 00:03:13,161
Yeah, great job.
Good stuff.

24
00:03:13,293 --> 00:03:15,495
Right, back to work.
Back to work.

25
00:03:17,965 --> 00:03:19,534
Right.

26
00:03:20,768 --> 00:03:23,838
And what about the store?
Are you, are you getting by?

27
00:03:25,073 --> 00:03:26,674
Had to let Terrance go.

28
00:03:27,709 --> 00:03:29,677
But I still open
every day.

29
00:03:29,811 --> 00:03:31,813
Not sure what else
to do with myself

30
00:03:31,946 --> 00:03:33,581
now that Betty's gone.

31
00:03:39,053 --> 00:03:40,655
Earl, I'm...

32
00:03:40,788 --> 00:03:43,323
I'm really sorry,
but if you can't pay,

33
00:03:43,457 --> 00:03:44,826
we're gonna have to foreclose.

34
00:03:49,130 --> 00:03:50,565
I understand.

35
00:04:00,942 --> 00:04:02,043
Okay.

36
00:04:02,176 --> 00:04:03,678
What I can do

37
00:04:03,811 --> 00:04:06,147
is I can hold on to
this paperwork
until after the holiday.

38
00:04:06,279 --> 00:04:08,683
That should buy you
enough time
for Betty's Social Security

39
00:04:08,816 --> 00:04:10,551
and retirement
to clear probate.

40
00:04:10,685 --> 00:04:13,453
Now, I can't promise that
it'll save the store, but...

41
00:04:14,589 --> 00:04:16,824
that should keep you
in your house.

42
00:04:18,025 --> 00:04:19,794
I appreciate that.

43
00:04:22,429 --> 00:04:24,599
Let me walk you out, okay?

44
00:04:27,434 --> 00:04:29,103
I'm so sorry again, Earl.

45
00:04:29,237 --> 00:04:30,738
I mean, I can't even imagine

46
00:04:30,872 --> 00:04:33,808
what it's like to lose someone
after 50 years of marriage.

47
00:04:35,710 --> 00:04:37,111
Time don't matter.

48
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:41,481
Would've hurt
just as bad if I lost her
the day we met.

49
00:04:42,917 --> 00:04:45,352
She brought the sunshine
in my life.

50
00:04:47,522 --> 00:04:48,890
Know what I mean?

51
00:04:50,357 --> 00:04:51,592
Yeah.

52
00:04:52,927 --> 00:04:53,961
Totally.

53
00:05:14,414 --> 00:05:16,050
Hey, Nate?
Oh.

54
00:05:16,184 --> 00:05:18,586
Hi! Hey, what's up?
Oh, my God!
I'm so sorry.

55
00:05:18,719 --> 00:05:20,054
Oh, no. That's fine.
Jesus!

56
00:05:20,188 --> 00:05:21,856
I can take care of that.
Holy shit.
I'm sorry.

57
00:05:21,989 --> 00:05:23,658
No, really,
you don't have to.

58
00:05:23,791 --> 00:05:25,560
I'm actually really good
at getting stains out.

59
00:05:25,693 --> 00:05:27,460
You actually don't
have to. I'm good.
I'll take care of it.

60
00:05:27,595 --> 00:05:29,396
I promise. Everything's--
Do not worry.

61
00:05:30,832 --> 00:05:32,033
I, uh...

62
00:05:33,734 --> 00:05:34,569
Uh, I...

63
00:05:34,702 --> 00:05:36,270
I go-- I have to, uh, go.

64
00:05:36,403 --> 00:05:37,672
Sorry.
Oh.

65
00:05:40,508 --> 00:05:43,376
Real smooth, idiot.

66
00:05:45,478 --> 00:05:46,914
Yeah, come in.
Hey.

67
00:05:47,048 --> 00:05:48,916
Sherry! Hey! Hi.

68
00:05:49,050 --> 00:05:50,818
Hi. Um...

69
00:05:50,952 --> 00:05:53,988
Am I just so very fired?

70
00:05:54,121 --> 00:05:55,656
I know I've only worked here
for four months,

71
00:05:55,790 --> 00:05:57,592
but I really feel like
I have a lot to contribute.

72
00:05:57,725 --> 00:06:00,828
No, no, you're not fired.
You're definitely not fired.
Are you sure?

73
00:06:00,962 --> 00:06:02,697
Yeah.
I feel like I at least
owe you a new shirt.

74
00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:06,234
Oh, this shirt? No.
No, no, no. This is...

75
00:06:06,366 --> 00:06:08,703
It's the worst shirt I have.

76
00:06:08,836 --> 00:06:10,938
Okay. Well, maybe
I could take you to lunch?

77
00:06:11,072 --> 00:06:12,273
Uh, yeah.

78
00:06:12,405 --> 00:06:13,641
Uh, no, actually.

79
00:06:13,774 --> 00:06:15,877
Sorry, I brought mine today,
so I'm okay.

80
00:06:16,409 --> 00:06:18,145
Okay. Yeah. No pressure.

81
00:06:18,279 --> 00:06:21,481
Okay.
But if you change
your mind, let me know.

82
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:23,784
Bye.

83
00:06:37,131 --> 00:06:39,000
Hey, uh...

84
00:06:39,133 --> 00:06:40,433
You know what?

85
00:06:41,434 --> 00:06:43,371
I'm in.
Okay.

86
00:06:43,504 --> 00:06:46,941
Cool. Leave in ten?
Yeah! Sounds good.

87
00:06:47,575 --> 00:06:48,843
Looking forward to it!

88
00:06:49,442 --> 00:06:50,811
Don't say that so loud.

89
00:06:57,518 --> 00:06:58,786
<i>Oh.</i>
<i>Welcome back, honey.</i>

90
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:00,988
I see you've brought
a friend this time.

91
00:07:01,122 --> 00:07:01,989
Yeah, this is Nate.

92
00:07:02,123 --> 00:07:03,891
Hey there, Nate.
What can I get you?

93
00:07:04,025 --> 00:07:07,194
Oh, you know,
just a milkshake, please.
Vanilla milkshake.

94
00:07:07,328 --> 00:07:10,064
You don't want any food?
They have
really good sandwiches.

95
00:07:10,197 --> 00:07:11,999
Really good sandwiches? Uh...

96
00:07:12,133 --> 00:07:13,234
Nah. I'm good.

97
00:07:13,367 --> 00:07:16,737
Okay. Um...
Then I'll have--

98
00:07:16,871 --> 00:07:19,240
Oh! Please tell me
you're not out
of the cherry pie.

99
00:07:19,373 --> 00:07:20,775
It's your lucky day.

100
00:07:20,908 --> 00:07:22,143
Got one left.
Oh, yes!

101
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:27,949
So...

102
00:07:30,618 --> 00:07:31,953
what's your deal?

103
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:34,055
Uh...

104
00:07:34,855 --> 00:07:36,657
My deal?
Yeah.

105
00:07:36,791 --> 00:07:38,225
You're just always, like,

106
00:07:38,359 --> 00:07:39,593
I don't know, in your office

107
00:07:39,727 --> 00:07:41,494
and you never come out
to the happy hours.

108
00:07:41,629 --> 00:07:45,333
I don't really know.
You know? I'm, um...

109
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:49,937
I guess I'm just not really
a... very social person.

110
00:07:51,372 --> 00:07:52,840
Okay.
Yeah.

111
00:07:54,108 --> 00:07:57,445
Do you have a girlfriend?
No. No, I don't.
Um, not...

112
00:07:57,578 --> 00:07:58,946
Not right now.

113
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:01,349
Are you on the apps?
No! God, no.

114
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:03,250
Why not? Really?
You'd do great.

115
00:08:03,384 --> 00:08:05,386
I could take
a profile picture
of you right now.

116
00:08:05,519 --> 00:08:06,721
The reindeer tie would slay.

117
00:08:06,854 --> 00:08:08,956
Oh, okay. All right.

118
00:08:09,790 --> 00:08:11,392
Thank you very much.

119
00:08:11,525 --> 00:08:14,562
Enjoy. Holler if
you need anything.

120
00:08:14,929 --> 00:08:15,963
Thank you.

121
00:08:18,199 --> 00:08:19,867
Mmm!
Mm-hmm.

122
00:08:20,935 --> 00:08:23,070
Oh, my God!
This is so good.
Cool.

123
00:08:23,204 --> 00:08:25,740
Do you want some?
Oh, no, I'm okay.

124
00:08:25,873 --> 00:08:28,075
You should have a bite.
I'm good. No, I'm--

125
00:08:28,209 --> 00:08:29,910
Really, Sherry, I'm fine.
Take a little bite.

126
00:08:30,044 --> 00:08:33,014
It's so good.
I can't. I can't! I can't.

127
00:08:33,981 --> 00:08:37,184
I'm sorry.
I just can't have any pie.

128
00:08:39,887 --> 00:08:41,655
What do you mean,
you can't?

129
00:08:41,789 --> 00:08:43,891
Uh...

130
00:08:44,025 --> 00:08:45,793
Okay, um...

131
00:08:48,763 --> 00:08:50,698
I have a genetic disorder.

132
00:08:51,565 --> 00:08:52,800
Oh.

133
00:08:54,168 --> 00:08:55,536
Okay.

134
00:08:57,705 --> 00:08:59,340
Go on.
Oh.

135
00:08:59,473 --> 00:09:01,042
Yeah, um...

136
00:09:01,175 --> 00:09:03,210
It's called CIPA.

137
00:09:03,344 --> 00:09:07,782
Congenital Insensitivity
to Pain with Anhidrosis.

138
00:09:07,915 --> 00:09:09,183
Um...

139
00:09:09,316 --> 00:09:11,185
It affects my nervous system.

140
00:09:11,318 --> 00:09:12,820
And it, uh...

141
00:09:12,953 --> 00:09:16,190
basically makes it
so I can't feel pain.

142
00:09:16,323 --> 00:09:17,324
Um...

143
00:09:17,458 --> 00:09:18,893
Or hot or cold.

144
00:09:19,026 --> 00:09:21,562
And that's why
I can't have the pie.

145
00:09:21,695 --> 00:09:24,698
Or any solid food,
really, because...

146
00:09:25,399 --> 00:09:28,035
unknowingly I could...

147
00:09:28,736 --> 00:09:30,404
bite my tongue off.

148
00:09:30,539 --> 00:09:32,840
Oh, the coffee earlier.

149
00:09:32,973 --> 00:09:36,343
Yeah, I couldn't feel
that at all.

150
00:09:36,477 --> 00:09:38,712
Holy shit!
Yeah.

151
00:09:39,313 --> 00:09:40,247
You're a superhero.

152
00:09:40,381 --> 00:09:42,850
Yeah, sure. Yeah.

153
00:09:42,983 --> 00:09:46,053
I have the power
to step on a nail,

154
00:09:46,187 --> 00:09:49,223
and not know until my shoe
fills up with, uh...

155
00:09:49,690 --> 00:09:50,691
blood.

156
00:09:50,825 --> 00:09:53,627
Right. Didn't think about that.

157
00:09:53,761 --> 00:09:56,430
True story, by the way.
We were at the aquarium,
my mom fainted.

158
00:09:56,565 --> 00:09:57,631
Jesus.
Yeah.

159
00:09:57,765 --> 00:09:59,767
My parents, they, um...

160
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:02,870
They basically spent my entire
childhood at the hospital.

161
00:10:03,003 --> 00:10:04,371
And then when they found out

162
00:10:04,506 --> 00:10:05,773
that the average
life expectancy

163
00:10:05,906 --> 00:10:09,643
for my condition was, um, 25,

164
00:10:09,777 --> 00:10:12,713
they sort of locked me up.

165
00:10:15,216 --> 00:10:16,083
I'm sorry.

166
00:10:16,217 --> 00:10:19,053
No, hey, I'm, you know, I'm...

167
00:10:19,186 --> 00:10:21,789
I'm still kicking.

168
00:10:22,490 --> 00:10:24,593
Okay. I mean,
I hear all that...

169
00:10:25,527 --> 00:10:27,428
but does that really mean
that you can't have

170
00:10:27,562 --> 00:10:29,598
just a little bite of this pie?

171
00:10:29,730 --> 00:10:31,665
No. Can't. I mean...

172
00:10:31,799 --> 00:10:34,068
Like I said,
I could bite my tongue off.

173
00:10:34,201 --> 00:10:36,103
You're not gonna bite
your tongue off, Nate.

174
00:10:36,237 --> 00:10:39,173
This is the best cherry pie
on the west coast, okay?

175
00:10:39,306 --> 00:10:40,674
I swear to God.

176
00:10:44,145 --> 00:10:47,715
Listen. If anything
goes wrong, I'm right here.

177
00:10:54,488 --> 00:10:55,856
Okay.

178
00:10:56,323 --> 00:10:57,358
Okay?

179
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:01,162
Here we go.
Taking a bite.
Yep.

180
00:11:01,295 --> 00:11:02,930
Open your mouth.

181
00:11:03,297 --> 00:11:04,331
Okay.

182
00:11:04,465 --> 00:11:07,835
Remember, chew softly. Yep.

183
00:11:08,802 --> 00:11:11,272
Uh-huh.
Let the magic happen.

184
00:11:15,577 --> 00:11:16,810
Uh-huh.

185
00:11:21,650 --> 00:11:24,018
My God, that is so good!

186
00:11:24,985 --> 00:11:27,821
That is so good. Oh, my God!

187
00:11:28,889 --> 00:11:30,659
Oh, my God! Wha--
Yeah, I told you.

188
00:11:30,791 --> 00:11:32,193
What?

189
00:11:32,326 --> 00:11:34,795
This is pie? This is pie.
Yeah!

190
00:11:34,929 --> 00:11:36,565
Pie's good.

191
00:11:36,697 --> 00:11:38,065
Congratulations.

192
00:11:38,199 --> 00:11:39,233
Whoa!

193
00:11:42,002 --> 00:11:44,238
What are you doing
later tonight?

194
00:11:47,041 --> 00:11:49,644
Look, she invited me out
to this art show.

195
00:11:49,777 --> 00:11:51,646
I'm just not gonna go.

196
00:11:51,779 --> 00:11:54,748
I think I'm just gonna
stay here and we'll play,
and it'll be fine.

197
00:11:54,882 --> 00:11:56,984
<i>You've been talking</i>
<i>about this girl for months.</i>

198
00:11:57,117 --> 00:11:58,452
<i>You're basically</i>
<i>in love with her.</i>

199
00:11:58,587 --> 00:12:00,655
<i>If I were you,</i>
<i>I'd be all over that shit!</i>

200
00:12:00,788 --> 00:12:02,089
But I'm not like you.

201
00:12:02,223 --> 00:12:04,158
I'm not cool.
I don't drive a Harley.

202
00:12:04,291 --> 00:12:06,227
I'm not this hunky guy
with a man bun.

203
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:08,128
<i>Again, it's a short pony.</i>

204
00:12:08,262 --> 00:12:10,297
<i>But dude, that stuff is not</i>
<i>why I do well with women.</i>

205
00:12:10,431 --> 00:12:12,701
<i>Does it help? Of course</i>
<i>it does, I'm not gonna lie.</i>

206
00:12:12,833 --> 00:12:14,935
<i>But confidence is king!</i>

207
00:12:15,970 --> 00:12:17,572
I feel like I'm gonna
mess it up somehow.

208
00:12:17,706 --> 00:12:19,608
<i>What's the worst</i>
<i>that can happen?</i>

209
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:22,109
<i>You wind up alone</i>
<i>in your living room</i>
<i>playing video games?</i>

210
00:12:22,243 --> 00:12:27,081
<i>You're already there, my guy!</i>
<i>What do you have to lose?</i>

211
00:12:32,286 --> 00:12:33,622
<i>Nate, you're gonna die.</i>
What?

212
00:12:33,754 --> 00:12:35,489
Oh, shit. Sorry. Um...

213
00:12:35,624 --> 00:12:37,191
Ah, okay.

214
00:12:37,324 --> 00:12:40,261
<i>No, no, no, that was</i>
<i>actually really impressive.</i>

215
00:12:40,394 --> 00:12:41,895
I'm sorry, my head's
not in this right now.

216
00:12:42,029 --> 00:12:43,531
Can I call you back
a little later?

217
00:12:43,665 --> 00:12:45,199
<i>Oh, sure, yeah.</i>
<i>I'll just go fuck myself.</i>

218
00:12:45,332 --> 00:12:47,034
Okay, thanks.

219
00:13:28,942 --> 00:13:31,278
Boo!
Hey! Hi.

220
00:13:31,412 --> 00:13:33,814
Hey. You came, you're here.
Yeah!

221
00:13:33,947 --> 00:13:36,584
No, of course. You know,
my schedule cleared up

222
00:13:36,718 --> 00:13:38,653
and, uh, yeah.
Cool. Well,
I'm glad you're here.

223
00:13:38,787 --> 00:13:40,888
Yeah, of course.
What do you think?

224
00:13:41,021 --> 00:13:42,590
These are yours?
Mm-hmm.

225
00:13:43,891 --> 00:13:46,093
These are awesome.
Oh, thank you.

226
00:13:46,661 --> 00:13:48,095
Who are they?

227
00:13:48,228 --> 00:13:50,130
Um, they're from
my therapy group.

228
00:13:50,264 --> 00:13:52,499
Some cutters, some suicidal.

229
00:13:52,634 --> 00:13:55,302
Everyone's kind of
recovering in their own way.

230
00:13:55,436 --> 00:13:58,005
Jesus, you run
a therapy group,
too? Huh.

231
00:13:58,138 --> 00:14:00,374
Oh.
No, no, no. I attend it.

232
00:14:00,508 --> 00:14:02,042
Oh. Oh.

233
00:14:03,410 --> 00:14:04,978
Damn, I'm so...
I'm sorry.

234
00:14:05,112 --> 00:14:07,981
No, no, no.
Don't apologize.
I did not mean...

235
00:14:08,115 --> 00:14:09,216
You're okay, it's fine.
Okay.

236
00:14:09,350 --> 00:14:10,518
I'm not ashamed of it.
Okay.

237
00:14:10,652 --> 00:14:13,387
- Oh, wait, you have a...
- Oh, God!

238
00:14:15,489 --> 00:14:16,758
I sold one.
Yeah.

239
00:14:16,890 --> 00:14:18,526
Why are you so surprised?

240
00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:21,395
Come on.

241
00:14:22,496 --> 00:14:23,598
Oh, yeah.

242
00:14:24,965 --> 00:14:27,968
Um... So,
where'd you grow up?

243
00:14:28,102 --> 00:14:31,472
Well, I grew up in Tucson.

244
00:14:32,439 --> 00:14:33,508
And Cedar City.

245
00:14:34,108 --> 00:14:36,009
And Sacramento.

246
00:14:36,611 --> 00:14:37,812
Hmm.

247
00:14:37,945 --> 00:14:39,581
I was in foster care.
Okay, yeah.

248
00:14:39,714 --> 00:14:42,784
So I just kind of
bounced around
until I was twelve

249
00:14:42,916 --> 00:14:44,519
and then I got adopted.

250
00:14:44,652 --> 00:14:46,487
And I had, you know, uh,

251
00:14:46,621 --> 00:14:49,591
my own room
and a big brother
and parents.

252
00:14:49,724 --> 00:14:51,225
And it was all
very exciting.

253
00:14:51,358 --> 00:14:53,628
That's amazing!
Do you still see them a lot?

254
00:14:54,962 --> 00:14:56,463
Not really, no.

255
00:14:56,598 --> 00:14:57,898
Um...

256
00:14:58,031 --> 00:15:00,602
It wasn't exactly
a loving household.

257
00:15:01,135 --> 00:15:02,069
Okay.
Yeah.

258
00:15:02,202 --> 00:15:04,004
Yeah.
So, I, uh...

259
00:15:05,038 --> 00:15:06,173
left when I was eighteen,

260
00:15:06,306 --> 00:15:07,941
and I've been
on my own ever since.

261
00:15:08,909 --> 00:15:12,146
Man, that is tough.
I'm sorry.

262
00:15:12,814 --> 00:15:13,748
It's fine.

263
00:15:13,882 --> 00:15:15,115
You know,

264
00:15:15,249 --> 00:15:17,418
if you don't have
anybody you care about,

265
00:15:17,552 --> 00:15:19,253
it's harder to get hurt,
right?

266
00:15:20,555 --> 00:15:22,055
Novocaine?

267
00:15:24,759 --> 00:15:26,360
Holy shit.

268
00:15:26,795 --> 00:15:27,928
It is you!

269
00:15:28,061 --> 00:15:29,864
I mean...
This is fucking wild.

270
00:15:29,997 --> 00:15:31,231
I...

271
00:15:31,365 --> 00:15:33,934
I thought
you'd be dead by now.

272
00:15:34,736 --> 00:15:36,036
Yeah, well...

273
00:15:36,671 --> 00:15:37,971
I'm not.
Yeah!

274
00:15:38,105 --> 00:15:39,674
Good for you, bro.

275
00:15:41,942 --> 00:15:43,944
Just like old times, huh?

276
00:15:44,077 --> 00:15:45,613
It's fucking Novocaine!

277
00:15:45,747 --> 00:15:47,448
And he's not fucking dead!

278
00:15:48,817 --> 00:15:50,217
So who was that?

279
00:15:50,350 --> 00:15:53,053
Oh. Uh, that was, um...

280
00:15:53,187 --> 00:15:55,557
some asshole that I went
to middle school with.

281
00:15:56,323 --> 00:15:59,694
And what did
he call you?
Novocaine?

282
00:16:00,728 --> 00:16:03,230
Yeah, uh, it was...

283
00:16:04,131 --> 00:16:06,634
It was just
some dumb nickname
they gave me.

284
00:16:06,768 --> 00:16:10,505
You know, once the other kids
found out about my condition,

285
00:16:10,638 --> 00:16:14,174
they basically started kicking
my ass pretty much daily,

286
00:16:14,308 --> 00:16:16,043
figuring it didn't matter,
you know,

287
00:16:16,176 --> 00:16:19,112
because I couldn't
feel any of it, so...

288
00:16:22,617 --> 00:16:23,651
I'm sorry.

289
00:16:25,018 --> 00:16:26,788
Yeah.
But...

290
00:16:27,622 --> 00:16:30,658
I got to say, as far
as nicknames go...

291
00:16:30,792 --> 00:16:32,827
"Novocaine"?

292
00:16:32,961 --> 00:16:36,430
Kind of badass.
No.

293
00:16:37,030 --> 00:16:38,365
Really?
Yeah! Yeah.

294
00:16:38,499 --> 00:16:41,536
Okay, well, thank you,
but they didn't think so.

295
00:16:42,269 --> 00:16:44,071
It-it... It was fine.

296
00:16:46,106 --> 00:16:49,376
S-Sorry. Um, excuse me for
one second. I'm just gonna...

297
00:16:51,378 --> 00:16:52,412
Hey!

298
00:16:52,847 --> 00:16:53,848
Yeah?

299
00:16:54,649 --> 00:16:56,551
What is the deal
with the alarm?

300
00:16:56,684 --> 00:16:58,085
Yeah, um...

301
00:16:59,253 --> 00:17:00,855
I got to set one of these
every three hours

302
00:17:00,989 --> 00:17:03,190
or else my bladder
might explode.

303
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:08,630
Other kids had a blast
with that one, too. Trust me.

304
00:17:34,889 --> 00:17:37,190
You're so funny.
Yeah,
I like to think I am.

305
00:17:37,324 --> 00:17:38,860
World-traveling
kinda guy.
Hey.

306
00:17:38,993 --> 00:17:41,295
Glad you two
are getting along.

307
00:17:41,428 --> 00:17:43,698
We really are.
He's hilarious.

308
00:17:45,033 --> 00:17:46,366
You know what?

309
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:49,037
I think you two just need to
let bygones be bygones.

310
00:17:49,169 --> 00:17:50,672
What do you say?

311
00:17:51,973 --> 00:17:54,642
What do you mean?
Shots! Duh!

312
00:17:54,776 --> 00:17:56,644
Come on. My treat.

313
00:17:56,778 --> 00:17:59,379
- Yeah, sure, why not?
- Nice. Okay, great.

314
00:17:59,514 --> 00:18:02,149
Hey, and, uh,
no hard feelings,
right?

315
00:18:03,216 --> 00:18:04,752
Yeah, sure.

316
00:18:06,621 --> 00:18:09,156
"Feelings." Get it?

317
00:18:09,289 --> 00:18:12,092
- That's so clever.
- This fucking guy.

318
00:18:13,595 --> 00:18:14,729
There you go.

319
00:18:14,862 --> 00:18:16,163
Thank you.

320
00:18:16,296 --> 00:18:17,832
Here you go.

321
00:18:28,275 --> 00:18:29,711
What the fuck was that?

322
00:18:31,111 --> 00:18:32,614
Yeah, what is that?

323
00:18:32,747 --> 00:18:36,450
Leapin' Larry's
Five Alarm
Ghost Pepper Sauce.

324
00:18:38,185 --> 00:18:39,554
Do you like it?

325
00:18:40,855 --> 00:18:43,390
Yeah,
it's Novocaine's favorite.

326
00:18:47,829 --> 00:18:50,965
Hey, should we, um,
head back to your place?

327
00:18:51,099 --> 00:18:52,834
You can put those on his tab.

328
00:18:52,967 --> 00:18:54,702
- No!
- Done.

329
00:18:57,170 --> 00:18:59,239
That was amazing.
That was...

330
00:18:59,373 --> 00:19:01,909
You're a
very good actor.
Oh, thank you.

331
00:19:02,043 --> 00:19:03,978
Oh, my God.
That's got to be
killing him

332
00:19:04,112 --> 00:19:06,480
thinking that
I'm taking you home.

333
00:19:07,782 --> 00:19:09,282
But you are.

334
00:19:10,183 --> 00:19:11,485
Wait, what?

335
00:19:18,126 --> 00:19:20,762
Have you really
read all these books?

336
00:19:22,195 --> 00:19:24,132
I don't get out much.

337
00:19:24,264 --> 00:19:26,734
Really?
You've even read the...

338
00:19:26,868 --> 00:19:29,637
<i>Mayo Clinic A-to-Z</i>
<i>Health Guide</i> ?

339
00:19:29,771 --> 00:19:33,107
When you can, um, impale
yourself without realizing it,

340
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:34,408
uh, you know,

341
00:19:34,542 --> 00:19:36,911
first aid knowledge
comes in pretty handy.

342
00:19:37,578 --> 00:19:38,613
Touché.

343
00:19:41,348 --> 00:19:43,785
You're a real Renaissance man,
Nathan Caine.

344
00:19:45,687 --> 00:19:47,522
I never would've guessed.

345
00:19:55,830 --> 00:19:57,598
Hi.
Hello.

346
00:19:59,433 --> 00:20:01,234
What else are you hiding?

347
00:20:03,236 --> 00:20:04,872
Sorry.
No.

348
00:20:05,006 --> 00:20:06,406
No, I'm sorry. Uh...

349
00:20:07,307 --> 00:20:08,609
It's okay.

350
00:20:09,143 --> 00:20:10,745
You sure?
Yeah.

351
00:20:22,857 --> 00:20:24,357
Is there more?

352
00:20:26,194 --> 00:20:28,763
There's a bit more,
yeah.

353
00:20:38,673 --> 00:20:39,707
Whoa.

354
00:20:42,210 --> 00:20:43,878
Nate, what the...

355
00:20:44,011 --> 00:20:46,480
What the fuck? Who are you?

356
00:20:46,614 --> 00:20:49,083
These are amazing.
Where did you get them done?

357
00:20:49,217 --> 00:20:50,518
Uh...

358
00:20:51,485 --> 00:20:54,021
I did them myself.
No, did you really?

359
00:20:54,155 --> 00:20:55,790
Yeah.
How long did that take you?

360
00:20:55,923 --> 00:20:56,924
Um...

361
00:20:57,058 --> 00:20:59,426
Well, it started
when I was a teenager and...

362
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:00,962
as I got better at it,

363
00:21:01,095 --> 00:21:04,364
I kind of got more sucked
into it, and it was, uh...

364
00:21:05,432 --> 00:21:07,535
It was just like, um,

365
00:21:09,170 --> 00:21:10,838
this secret world.

366
00:21:10,972 --> 00:21:12,006
This...

367
00:21:13,174 --> 00:21:15,176
This other life that,

368
00:21:15,308 --> 00:21:17,912
you know,
was actually an adventure.

369
00:21:18,846 --> 00:21:20,648
It's a story, isn't it?

370
00:21:21,983 --> 00:21:23,985
Yeah. Yeah, you could...

371
00:21:24,118 --> 00:21:26,020
You could
call it that, yeah.

372
00:21:28,256 --> 00:21:29,724
How does it end?

373
00:21:30,992 --> 00:21:32,660
I don't know. Um...

374
00:21:33,561 --> 00:21:35,362
I'm still figuring that out.

375
00:21:38,398 --> 00:21:39,834
So, I have a question.

376
00:21:41,736 --> 00:21:45,039
If you can't feel pain,

377
00:21:45,173 --> 00:21:51,378
does that also mean
that you can't feel...

378
00:21:51,879 --> 00:21:52,914
pleasure?

379
00:22:00,353 --> 00:22:01,923
I mean, uh...

380
00:22:02,957 --> 00:22:04,357
I think I can.

381
00:22:05,492 --> 00:22:07,995
Can you feel this?

382
00:22:11,899 --> 00:22:14,735
I feel a little bit
of pressure.

383
00:22:16,170 --> 00:22:17,538
Okay.

384
00:22:18,606 --> 00:22:20,074
How about this?

385
00:22:27,815 --> 00:22:29,750
Definitely feeling something.

386
00:22:50,470 --> 00:22:51,772
You're...

387
00:22:52,405 --> 00:22:53,808
gorgeous.

388
00:22:56,811 --> 00:22:58,946
It's not just you, Nate.

389
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:02,650
Everybody is hiding something.

390
00:23:04,218 --> 00:23:06,053
I think we're all just...

391
00:23:08,055 --> 00:23:10,725
looking for someone
we can show it to.

392
00:24:10,051 --> 00:24:11,519
Yes!

393
00:24:22,229 --> 00:24:23,597
Sorry!

394
00:24:46,253 --> 00:24:49,323
"Hey, Sherry, so last night
was life-changing."

395
00:24:49,457 --> 00:24:51,892
No, no, no. Way too big. Uh...

396
00:24:52,660 --> 00:24:54,195
"Last night was really great."

397
00:24:54,328 --> 00:24:55,563
Uh...

398
00:24:56,063 --> 00:24:57,999
"Last night was...

399
00:24:58,132 --> 00:24:59,633
amazing."

400
00:25:01,869 --> 00:25:05,940
Ho, ho, ho!

401
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:07,408
Ah, gentlemen.

402
00:25:07,541 --> 00:25:09,210
Love the outfits.

403
00:25:09,343 --> 00:25:10,811
How can I help you?

404
00:25:10,945 --> 00:25:12,613
We're here
to make a withdrawal.

405
00:25:14,815 --> 00:25:16,150
Get down on the fucking ground!

406
00:25:16,283 --> 00:25:17,985
Get down! Get down!

407
00:25:18,119 --> 00:25:20,287
Get on the fucking ground!

408
00:25:20,421 --> 00:25:22,490
- Take the back!
- Get on the ground!

409
00:25:22,623 --> 00:25:25,092
Get down!
All right, everyone.

410
00:25:25,226 --> 00:25:27,094
Do exactly as we say

411
00:25:27,228 --> 00:25:29,363
and you'll all live
to open up your presents.

412
00:25:29,497 --> 00:25:32,633
Phones on the ground
in front of you!

413
00:25:32,767 --> 00:25:34,635
Hands behind your heads!

414
00:25:36,437 --> 00:25:38,339
Mr. Manager...

415
00:25:38,472 --> 00:25:39,707
...you're up.

416
00:25:45,346 --> 00:25:47,014
Alarm's tripped!

417
00:25:47,148 --> 00:25:48,315
Three minutes!

418
00:25:52,086 --> 00:25:53,054
Open the vault.

419
00:25:53,187 --> 00:25:54,855
I won't be able to
open it in time.

420
00:25:54,989 --> 00:25:56,557
2:45.

421
00:25:57,458 --> 00:25:59,627
Open the vault
or I will kill you.

422
00:26:02,263 --> 00:26:04,965
No. I won't do it.

423
00:26:07,868 --> 00:26:09,170
He won't do it.

424
00:26:09,303 --> 00:26:11,138
Man called my bluff.

425
00:26:16,043 --> 00:26:17,278
I...

426
00:26:17,812 --> 00:26:19,080
asked you...

427
00:26:19,548 --> 00:26:20,748
very nicely!

428
00:26:25,352 --> 00:26:27,188
Captain Kringle?
Huh?

429
00:26:27,321 --> 00:26:28,656
Your beard.

430
00:26:36,565 --> 00:26:38,499
Sorry, buddy.

431
00:26:38,632 --> 00:26:40,000
You saw my face.

432
00:26:44,506 --> 00:26:46,107
Assistant manager!

433
00:26:48,175 --> 00:26:49,810
Your turn!

434
00:26:54,516 --> 00:26:55,749
Two minutes.

435
00:27:00,721 --> 00:27:02,123
Combination!

436
00:27:04,091 --> 00:27:05,926
Say the fucking combination!

437
00:27:07,128 --> 00:27:09,163
What the fuck
is wrong with you?

438
00:27:09,296 --> 00:27:10,664
1:30.

439
00:27:10,798 --> 00:27:12,500
Hey. Hey.
Hmm.

440
00:27:12,633 --> 00:27:14,034
Look at me.

441
00:27:15,402 --> 00:27:17,506
Say the fucking numbers.

442
00:27:17,638 --> 00:27:18,873
Wha-- What?

443
00:27:27,549 --> 00:27:28,782
No, no, no!

444
00:27:30,484 --> 00:27:31,520
Don't.

445
00:27:31,652 --> 00:27:32,786
Huh.

446
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:35,389
Okay. Have it your way.

447
00:27:35,856 --> 00:27:36,924
Wait, hey, hey.

448
00:27:37,057 --> 00:27:39,260
Wait! Wait! Wait! No!

449
00:27:39,393 --> 00:27:40,828
Don't! Stop, stop, stop!

450
00:27:40,961 --> 00:27:42,696
Okay, here's the deal.

451
00:27:42,830 --> 00:27:44,765
Open the vault
or I open her brain pan.

452
00:27:44,899 --> 00:27:46,066
Okay, okay.

453
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:47,735
Three, two, one.
Okay! I'm telling you!

454
00:27:47,868 --> 00:27:50,738
I'm telling you!
Stop it! I'm telling you!

455
00:27:52,507 --> 00:27:55,342
01-32-26.

456
00:28:00,848 --> 00:28:02,449
Was that so hard?

457
00:28:10,625 --> 00:28:12,293
Come on, come on, come on.

458
00:28:15,496 --> 00:28:17,064
Holy shit.

459
00:28:17,198 --> 00:28:19,466
Merry Christmas, motherfucker.

460
00:28:23,737 --> 00:28:25,139
Come to me, baby.

461
00:28:26,740 --> 00:28:28,242
Cops are here early!

462
00:28:28,375 --> 00:28:29,644
Go. Let's move it!

463
00:28:29,777 --> 00:28:31,278
Take the bag!
He's got the other.

464
00:28:31,412 --> 00:28:32,880
Let's move!

465
00:28:33,013 --> 00:28:34,683
Grab a fucking hostage.

466
00:28:34,815 --> 00:28:36,450
Sorry, sweetheart.

467
00:28:38,152 --> 00:28:39,720
Come on.

468
00:28:41,188 --> 00:28:44,091
Here we go.
Don't fucking look at me!

469
00:28:45,893 --> 00:28:47,328
Merry Christmas.

470
00:28:48,329 --> 00:28:51,765
All right,
three, two, one.
Move!

471
00:28:57,805 --> 00:28:59,340
Guns on the ground!

472
00:28:59,473 --> 00:29:02,276
Okay! Okay.

473
00:29:02,943 --> 00:29:04,345
Just take it easy.

474
00:29:08,849 --> 00:29:10,384
Nobody needs to get hurt.

475
00:29:10,518 --> 00:29:11,752
Go.

476
00:29:59,900 --> 00:30:02,102
Hurry up, asshole!
Let's go!

477
00:30:12,313 --> 00:30:13,347
Sherry.

478
00:30:40,074 --> 00:30:41,408
Help me.

479
00:30:45,979 --> 00:30:46,914
Damn it.

480
00:30:47,047 --> 00:30:49,517
All right.

481
00:30:52,721 --> 00:30:53,921
Hey, hey.

482
00:30:54,556 --> 00:30:55,489
You're gonna be okay.

483
00:30:55,623 --> 00:30:56,558
All right?

484
00:30:56,691 --> 00:30:58,325
Just keep pressure on it.

485
00:30:58,459 --> 00:31:02,129
<i>32 and 34,</i>
<i>backup eight minutes out.</i>

486
00:31:02,697 --> 00:31:04,198
Eight minutes?

487
00:31:12,406 --> 00:31:13,440
Don't.

488
00:31:15,309 --> 00:31:17,612
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

489
00:31:17,746 --> 00:31:19,647
I will bring it back.
Come on!

490
00:31:20,749 --> 00:31:22,550
Oh, my God, what am I doing?

491
00:31:47,842 --> 00:31:49,076
Hey, you good?

492
00:31:49,878 --> 00:31:51,311
Good?

493
00:31:51,445 --> 00:31:53,313
I'm better than good.
We're rich, motherfuckers!

494
00:31:53,447 --> 00:31:54,816
It's not about the money.

495
00:31:54,948 --> 00:31:57,284
What is important
is that we had fun.

496
00:32:01,823 --> 00:32:03,658
Aw, fuck, I'm going fast.

497
00:32:07,027 --> 00:32:07,961
Guys?

498
00:32:08,095 --> 00:32:09,631
<i>We've got company.</i>

499
00:32:09,764 --> 00:32:11,699
<i>These fucking cops!</i>

500
00:32:15,002 --> 00:32:16,403
Oh, fuck!

501
00:32:22,209 --> 00:32:23,745
Okay. Okay. You're okay.

502
00:32:23,878 --> 00:32:25,112
You're okay, you're okay.

503
00:32:31,418 --> 00:32:32,520
Fuck, he's still coming!

504
00:32:32,654 --> 00:32:34,254
What's your fucking call,
genius?

505
00:32:34,388 --> 00:32:36,156
Split up.
Meet back at the shop.

506
00:32:36,290 --> 00:32:37,659
Get on the highway.
No, no, no.

507
00:32:37,792 --> 00:32:39,393
Ain't getting on the highway.
Get on the highway.

508
00:32:39,527 --> 00:32:40,728
I want to stay there.
He needs us.

509
00:32:40,862 --> 00:32:43,330
Do it!
He's--

510
00:32:45,834 --> 00:32:47,134
Come on. Which one, Sherry?

511
00:32:52,941 --> 00:32:54,542
Please be the one.
Please be the one.

512
00:32:59,547 --> 00:33:01,014
Shit! Jesus!

513
00:33:01,749 --> 00:33:03,383
Oh, shit!

514
00:33:08,957 --> 00:33:09,990
What the fuck?

515
00:33:12,192 --> 00:33:13,126
Hey, are you okay?

516
00:33:13,260 --> 00:33:14,228
Sorry. No, I'm sorry.

517
00:33:14,361 --> 00:33:16,029
Where you going?

518
00:33:17,632 --> 00:33:18,733
Out of the way!

519
00:33:18,867 --> 00:33:20,234
Fuck off!

520
00:33:26,674 --> 00:33:29,009
Oh, hey, hey. Hey, look.

521
00:33:29,142 --> 00:33:32,045
Look, I don't want any trouble.
I just want to know
where Sherry is.

522
00:33:32,479 --> 00:33:33,515
Wait.

523
00:33:34,849 --> 00:33:35,817
You're not a cop?

524
00:33:35,950 --> 00:33:37,351
Uh, no, but...

525
00:33:37,484 --> 00:33:39,486
Come on, man.
Just tell me where she is.

526
00:33:39,621 --> 00:33:42,356
I'll let you go. Okay?

527
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:47,762
You ever fired
a gun before?

528
00:33:50,732 --> 00:33:55,068
Do you, uh...
even know where
the safety is? Hmm?

529
00:33:55,202 --> 00:33:56,604
Mm-hmm.

530
00:34:03,210 --> 00:34:04,512
Hey, wait!

531
00:34:10,952 --> 00:34:12,554
Hey, man.

532
00:34:12,687 --> 00:34:14,454
I don't want to fight, okay?
I'm not that guy. I just want--

533
00:34:23,497 --> 00:34:25,633
Get the fuck out of my way.
Move!

534
00:34:29,369 --> 00:34:31,271
You're fucking dead,
you know that?

535
00:34:43,116 --> 00:34:45,185
Just tell me. Please.

536
00:34:47,655 --> 00:34:48,656
Motherfuck--

537
00:34:49,691 --> 00:34:51,391
Okay, so those are
definitely third degree,

538
00:34:51,526 --> 00:34:53,528
so you're gonna want
to run it under some cool--

539
00:34:54,963 --> 00:34:56,263
I'm not done with you.

540
00:34:56,396 --> 00:34:58,465
Okay, wait, hold on.
Come here.

541
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:01,268
Look, I still feel like we can
both get what we want here.

542
00:35:01,401 --> 00:35:03,538
Oh, you're strong!

543
00:35:09,077 --> 00:35:10,979
Ooh, I am so sorry.

544
00:35:22,255 --> 00:35:24,124
Hey, last chance.

545
00:35:24,257 --> 00:35:26,894
Tell me where she is.
Eat shit.

546
00:35:34,102 --> 00:35:36,470
Okay, okay. Uh...

547
00:35:41,676 --> 00:35:42,710
Come here!

548
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:08,503
You don't have, like,
a gluten thing, do you?

549
00:36:38,866 --> 00:36:39,901
Hey.

550
00:36:41,102 --> 00:36:42,402
Hey, man, you okay?

551
00:36:56,918 --> 00:36:58,720
Oh, shit. Okay, okay.

552
00:36:58,853 --> 00:37:00,454
You had to do it.
You had to do it.

553
00:37:00,588 --> 00:37:02,222
Think about Sherry.

554
00:37:21,976 --> 00:37:23,276
"At work."

555
00:37:24,879 --> 00:37:25,847
At work.

556
00:37:25,980 --> 00:37:27,548
Um...

557
00:37:27,682 --> 00:37:28,783
Hey, what?

558
00:37:35,189 --> 00:37:36,924
Okay, okay.

559
00:37:40,728 --> 00:37:41,662
All right.

560
00:38:14,294 --> 00:38:16,798
<i>I'm sorry,</i>
<i>so Sherry was kidnapped</i>

561
00:38:16,931 --> 00:38:18,465
<i>and you killed a guy</i>
<i>in a kitchen?</i>

562
00:38:18,599 --> 00:38:19,934
Roscoe, just listen to me
very carefully.

563
00:38:20,067 --> 00:38:22,369
I don't have a lot of--
Oh, my God, I got shot.

564
00:38:22,503 --> 00:38:23,838
<i>What, you got shot?</i>
Just listen.

565
00:38:23,971 --> 00:38:26,040
I just texted you a photo
of a tattoo.

566
00:38:26,174 --> 00:38:28,475
I need you to call around
to every parlor in San Diego

567
00:38:28,609 --> 00:38:29,844
and try to find out
who did the art.

568
00:38:29,977 --> 00:38:31,344
<i>What am I,</i>
<i>your fucking secretary?</i>

569
00:38:31,478 --> 00:38:32,847
<i>I'm not doing shit!</i>

570
00:38:32,980 --> 00:38:35,016
Roscoe, I wouldn't ask
if I had any other choice.

571
00:38:35,149 --> 00:38:36,150
I mean, we're a team, right?

572
00:38:36,284 --> 00:38:37,450
<i>Yes, a video game team.</i>

573
00:38:37,585 --> 00:38:38,953
<i>We've never even met in person.</i>

574
00:38:39,086 --> 00:38:41,923
<i>And now you're involving me</i>
<i>in a real-life murder?</i>

575
00:38:42,056 --> 00:38:43,390
<i>Why don't you</i>
<i>just call the police?</i>

576
00:38:43,524 --> 00:38:45,760
You know,
I technically stole a cop car.

577
00:38:45,893 --> 00:38:47,929
Then there's the whole thing
about the guy that I killed.

578
00:38:48,062 --> 00:38:50,164
<i>Fine. Jesus.</i>
<i>I'll get you the address,</i>

579
00:38:50,298 --> 00:38:51,265
<i>but that's it, okay?</i>

580
00:38:51,398 --> 00:38:52,432
Okay, thank you!

581
00:38:52,567 --> 00:38:53,801
Thank you, bye.

582
00:39:03,845 --> 00:39:05,746
Details are still trickling in,

583
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:08,716
but we have confirmed reports
of multiple fatalities.

584
00:39:08,850 --> 00:39:10,218
Citizens are advised to report

585
00:39:10,350 --> 00:39:12,452
any suspicious activity
in their area

586
00:39:12,587 --> 00:39:14,655
but to not engage
with possible suspects.

587
00:39:14,789 --> 00:39:16,858
Shit.
Bad week to quit drinking.

588
00:39:17,658 --> 00:39:19,861
You quit drinking?

589
00:39:19,994 --> 00:39:22,296
No, no.
I just mean it would be.

590
00:39:22,429 --> 00:39:24,232
Detective!
Yeah, what do you got?

591
00:39:24,364 --> 00:39:25,365
There's three officers down.

592
00:39:25,498 --> 00:39:27,034
One in the ICU.

593
00:39:27,168 --> 00:39:29,469
Bank manager DOA inside.

594
00:39:29,604 --> 00:39:31,404
Three gunmen, two cars.

595
00:39:31,539 --> 00:39:33,207
They took a hostage with them.

596
00:39:33,341 --> 00:39:35,176
And one additional suspect
at large.

597
00:39:35,309 --> 00:39:36,310
Additional suspect?

598
00:39:36,443 --> 00:39:38,378
Yeah, the assistant manager.

599
00:39:38,512 --> 00:39:40,615
He stole a cruiser
and followed the gunmen.

600
00:39:40,748 --> 00:39:43,150
Witnesses say it's
the same guy
who opened the vault.

601
00:39:44,685 --> 00:39:46,419
Could be a double-cross.

602
00:39:47,355 --> 00:39:48,522
Do we have units in pursuit?

603
00:39:48,656 --> 00:39:50,457
No, these were
the only ones in the area.

604
00:39:50,591 --> 00:39:51,993
Calls went out
to the Fifth and Sixth,

605
00:39:52,126 --> 00:39:54,494
but they're spread thin
'cause of the holidays.

606
00:39:54,629 --> 00:39:56,898
Okay, thank you, Officer.
Thank you.

607
00:40:00,034 --> 00:40:02,737
We need to get a file on
that assistant manager, quick.

608
00:40:02,870 --> 00:40:04,672
Today was supposed to be
an easy one.

609
00:40:07,508 --> 00:40:08,475
I'm going.
Thanks.

610
00:40:08,609 --> 00:40:09,810
I'm going.

611
00:40:10,778 --> 00:40:12,412
Coming through, newsies!
Out of my way!

612
00:40:12,546 --> 00:40:13,781
Come on.

613
00:40:49,083 --> 00:40:51,986
Closed for lunch!
Come back later!

614
00:40:54,055 --> 00:40:55,089
Hmm.

615
00:40:57,490 --> 00:40:59,660
Hey! It's me! Nate!

616
00:40:59,794 --> 00:41:01,395
What in the Sam Hill?

617
00:41:01,529 --> 00:41:03,731
From the bank.
Could you let me in?

618
00:41:05,032 --> 00:41:06,466
Hi.

619
00:41:11,505 --> 00:41:13,841
You sure you don't want me
to just call you an ambulance?

620
00:41:13,975 --> 00:41:15,843
Uh, no. I told you.
There's no time.

621
00:41:17,078 --> 00:41:18,012
All right.

622
00:41:19,580 --> 00:41:20,848
Sweet Jesus!

623
00:41:20,982 --> 00:41:22,216
Here we go.

624
00:41:27,088 --> 00:41:30,624
Earl, you okay?
Me? Oh, yeah, just--

625
00:41:30,758 --> 00:41:33,227
This was not
what I expected today.

626
00:41:33,361 --> 00:41:35,696
Hey, if it's
any consolation,
me neither.

627
00:41:36,998 --> 00:41:38,032
All right.

628
00:41:38,566 --> 00:41:39,900
All right.

629
00:41:40,668 --> 00:41:42,003
If I can find it.

630
00:41:44,638 --> 00:41:46,974
Huh. Is that it?

631
00:41:49,410 --> 00:41:51,579
Hey! There we go.
Ah!

632
00:41:53,214 --> 00:41:54,815
All right.

633
00:41:57,418 --> 00:41:58,819
Just some of this.

634
00:41:59,487 --> 00:42:00,888
Just a little bit.

635
00:42:02,356 --> 00:42:03,991
Okay.

636
00:42:04,458 --> 00:42:05,526
Here we go.

637
00:42:07,595 --> 00:42:09,597
Yeah. There we go, see?

638
00:42:10,498 --> 00:42:12,299
Good as new.

639
00:42:12,433 --> 00:42:15,102
Oh, whoa. Um...

640
00:42:15,236 --> 00:42:16,637
Earl, was there--

641
00:42:16,771 --> 00:42:18,439
There's an EpiPen
in there, right?

642
00:42:18,572 --> 00:42:20,074
You mind
handing that to me?

643
00:42:20,775 --> 00:42:22,610
What?
You allergic to something?

644
00:42:22,743 --> 00:42:24,078
Um, thank you, no, uh...

645
00:42:24,211 --> 00:42:26,113
epinephrine's just
another form
of adrenaline.

646
00:42:26,247 --> 00:42:29,784
It should, uh, keep me
from passing out.

647
00:42:35,823 --> 00:42:37,058
Yeah, that did it.

648
00:42:37,658 --> 00:42:39,026
Okay.

649
00:42:41,462 --> 00:42:43,798
Yeah, all right. Hey, Earl.

650
00:42:43,931 --> 00:42:45,833
Thank you so much.
Sorry, this was...

651
00:42:46,333 --> 00:42:47,268
a lot.

652
00:42:47,401 --> 00:42:49,570
You go get that girl, Nate.

653
00:42:52,673 --> 00:42:54,241
Oh, hey, um...

654
00:42:55,544 --> 00:42:59,080
Almost forgot.
This should help with
the mortgage for a while.

655
00:43:01,749 --> 00:43:03,951
Betty always said
you were a good kid.

656
00:43:08,722 --> 00:43:09,957
Oh! Sorry.

657
00:43:10,991 --> 00:43:13,494
All right, uh,
I'll see you later.

658
00:43:13,627 --> 00:43:15,296
You know, if I--
If I don't, uh, die.

659
00:43:25,172 --> 00:43:27,641
You might want to
launder that,
by the way.

660
00:43:28,342 --> 00:43:29,376
Ah.

661
00:44:07,348 --> 00:44:08,782
One of our bank robbers?

662
00:44:08,916 --> 00:44:10,718
God, I hope so.

663
00:44:10,851 --> 00:44:13,120
Be a shame
if it was
the real Santa.

664
00:44:13,254 --> 00:44:18,058
Kitchen staff said a crazy guy
in a tie did all this.

665
00:44:18,893 --> 00:44:21,162
I'm thinking that's
our assistant manager.

666
00:44:21,795 --> 00:44:23,164
Oh, speaking of...

667
00:44:25,634 --> 00:44:27,401
Got a bit of a profile on him.

668
00:44:30,337 --> 00:44:31,705
Uh, Nathan Caine.

669
00:44:31,839 --> 00:44:33,741
Single. Male. Thirty.

670
00:44:33,874 --> 00:44:35,809
No record. No affiliations.

671
00:44:35,943 --> 00:44:37,912
Zero traffic tickets.

672
00:44:38,045 --> 00:44:41,982
An online gamer tag
of "Magicnateball."

673
00:44:42,483 --> 00:44:44,218
Oh, that's good. Uh...

674
00:44:44,351 --> 00:44:47,522
Worked at San Diego Trust
for six years.

675
00:44:47,656 --> 00:44:50,758
That just doesn't sound
like a stone-cold killer to me.

676
00:44:51,325 --> 00:44:52,826
And yet...

677
00:44:54,529 --> 00:44:55,564
Yeah.

678
00:44:56,397 --> 00:44:58,533
Do you have
a cell phone number
for him?

679
00:44:58,667 --> 00:45:01,235
Guy just robbed a bank,
killed a guy.

680
00:45:01,368 --> 00:45:03,470
Do you really think he's just
picking up his cell phone?

681
00:45:05,372 --> 00:45:07,808
- This is Nate speaking.
<i>- Hi, Nate.</i>

682
00:45:07,942 --> 00:45:09,910
Uh, this is
Detective Barbara Mincy

683
00:45:10,044 --> 00:45:12,079
of the San Diego Police.

684
00:45:12,213 --> 00:45:13,147
How you doing?

685
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:14,649
<i>I've-- I've been better.</i>

686
00:45:14,782 --> 00:45:16,050
Did you catch the others?

687
00:45:16,183 --> 00:45:18,219
Is Sherry, the hostage,
is she safe?

688
00:45:18,352 --> 00:45:20,321
Yeah, well, you know,
we're working on that.

689
00:45:20,454 --> 00:45:22,557
But whatever it is you're doing
isn't making our job easier.

690
00:45:22,691 --> 00:45:25,459
So if you could turn yourself
and the cash in right now--

691
00:45:25,594 --> 00:45:27,261
Whoa, wait, wait, sorry. Um...

692
00:45:29,430 --> 00:45:31,365
Holy shit.
You think I'm in on this.

693
00:45:31,498 --> 00:45:33,635
<i>No, no, Nate, uh,</i>
<i>we're just following</i>
<i>the facts here.</i>

694
00:45:33,767 --> 00:45:37,004
Look, hey, I don't
give a shit about the money.
I just want to save Sherry.

695
00:45:37,137 --> 00:45:40,341
Mm-hmm. Well, that's our job
to worry about, not yours.

696
00:45:40,474 --> 00:45:42,943
Yeah, well, I heard that
75% of hostages who die

697
00:45:43,077 --> 00:45:45,012
are killed in the first
three hours, so...

698
00:45:45,145 --> 00:45:46,814
<i>Unless you're calling me</i>
<i>to tell me you found her,</i>

699
00:45:46,947 --> 00:45:48,349
<i>I'm not gonna stop.</i>

700
00:45:48,983 --> 00:45:50,217
This Sherry...

701
00:45:51,051 --> 00:45:53,053
She, uh, she your girlfriend?

702
00:45:53,187 --> 00:45:55,222
<i>Yeah, I mean, you know,</i>
<i>we haven't necessarily</i>

703
00:45:55,356 --> 00:45:57,258
<i>put a label on anything yet,</i>
<i>but the--</i>

704
00:45:57,391 --> 00:45:59,126
Stop it, all right? I know
what you're trying to do.

705
00:45:59,260 --> 00:46:00,629
You don't give a shit about us.

706
00:46:00,761 --> 00:46:01,996
No, Nate, that's not true.

707
00:46:02,129 --> 00:46:04,699
We just want everyone
to get home safe, okay?

708
00:46:04,832 --> 00:46:06,100
I understand you care
about her, but--

709
00:46:06,233 --> 00:46:07,268
<i>Do you?</i>

710
00:46:09,336 --> 00:46:12,439
Do you know what it's like
to wait your whole life
to meet someone?

711
00:46:13,874 --> 00:46:15,909
Someone who changes everything?
Who...

712
00:46:17,111 --> 00:46:19,213
finally gives your life
meaning?

713
00:46:21,415 --> 00:46:23,884
Yeah. Yeah, I do.

714
00:46:25,520 --> 00:46:26,554
My daughter.

715
00:46:30,692 --> 00:46:32,092
And if your daughter
was kidnapped,

716
00:46:32,226 --> 00:46:34,529
<i>would you wait around</i>
<i>for someone else to save her?</i>

717
00:46:35,697 --> 00:46:37,197
Or would you do it yourself?

718
00:46:44,972 --> 00:46:47,374
All right, Nate.
Have it your way.

719
00:46:57,652 --> 00:46:59,253
Got a trace on his cell.

720
00:47:03,891 --> 00:47:05,225
Hey, you good?

721
00:47:05,727 --> 00:47:07,194
Yeah. Let's move.

722
00:47:10,097 --> 00:47:15,804
<i>11898, I show your dispatch</i>
<i>and send 29C-47.</i>

723
00:47:15,936 --> 00:47:18,606
This is a total fucking
shit show, man.

724
00:47:18,740 --> 00:47:21,810
Look, there's nothing
on the scanner
about your brother.

725
00:47:21,942 --> 00:47:23,778
That means he probably
lost the tail.

726
00:47:23,911 --> 00:47:25,680
Then why the fuck
ain't he here?

727
00:47:26,213 --> 00:47:27,848
I don't know!

728
00:47:27,981 --> 00:47:30,284
Okay? I don't know.
I'm sorry.
I don't know everything.

729
00:47:31,952 --> 00:47:34,888
Maybe he had to
switch vehicles.

730
00:47:35,022 --> 00:47:37,424
Maybe he stopped off
to get some ice cream.

731
00:47:37,559 --> 00:47:40,127
The point is, your fucking
whining about it

732
00:47:40,260 --> 00:47:42,863
isn't gonna make him
show up any faster.

733
00:47:45,199 --> 00:47:46,967
Watch how
you're talking to me.

734
00:47:47,101 --> 00:47:48,135
You may be running point
on this,

735
00:47:48,268 --> 00:47:50,104
but you're not
my fucking boss.

736
00:47:50,839 --> 00:47:52,072
Hmm.

737
00:47:52,707 --> 00:47:53,907
Andre...

738
00:47:54,041 --> 00:47:56,910
I need you to switch up
the vibe right now.

739
00:47:59,346 --> 00:48:01,949
Because you're bumming me out.

740
00:48:02,784 --> 00:48:04,051
Come on.

741
00:48:04,184 --> 00:48:05,854
Ben is gonna be back
in 15 minutes

742
00:48:05,986 --> 00:48:08,055
and everything
is gonna be fine.

743
00:48:08,188 --> 00:48:11,593
Just keep saying it.
"Everything is gonna be fine."

744
00:48:11,726 --> 00:48:13,160
Yeah, fucking right.

745
00:48:21,969 --> 00:48:24,271
No more silent treatment,
huh?

746
00:48:29,878 --> 00:48:31,111
Hey.

747
00:48:32,279 --> 00:48:34,148
I'm sorry I hit you,
okay?

748
00:48:37,017 --> 00:48:38,385
Do you, um...

749
00:48:40,120 --> 00:48:41,355
Do you want to hit me?

750
00:48:41,488 --> 00:48:43,257
Make it even?

751
00:48:44,024 --> 00:48:45,426
Fuck you.

752
00:48:46,360 --> 00:48:47,394
Wow.

753
00:48:49,697 --> 00:48:51,298
I do not like that tone.

754
00:48:52,700 --> 00:48:54,001
I don't like it.

755
00:48:55,637 --> 00:48:58,939
But I got just the thing
to fix that attitude.

756
00:49:12,787 --> 00:49:14,488
Oh, come on!

757
00:49:14,622 --> 00:49:17,024
You love cola gummies.
Stop it, Simon!

758
00:49:17,559 --> 00:49:18,492
Stop.

759
00:49:18,626 --> 00:49:19,761
What is this?

760
00:49:19,894 --> 00:49:22,429
Who is this little tantrum for?

761
00:49:24,899 --> 00:49:26,967
We're alone now.

762
00:49:27,100 --> 00:49:29,871
You can feel free
to break character
whenever you'd like, sis.

763
00:49:30,003 --> 00:49:31,906
It's just that you promised
nobody would get hurt, okay?

764
00:49:32,039 --> 00:49:33,140
You fucking promised.

765
00:49:33,273 --> 00:49:34,475
It's the heat of battle,
Sher.

766
00:49:34,609 --> 00:49:36,210
Shit happens.
The heat of battle?

767
00:49:36,343 --> 00:49:37,579
You did not have
to kill Nigel!

768
00:49:37,712 --> 00:49:40,481
Nigel? Who is Nigel?

769
00:49:40,615 --> 00:49:41,916
The bank manager.

770
00:49:42,049 --> 00:49:44,117
He was a nice fucking guy.

771
00:49:44,251 --> 00:49:45,920
He was a Nigel too,
wasn't he?

772
00:49:46,053 --> 00:49:48,088
Nigel.

773
00:49:51,358 --> 00:49:52,627
Sher.

774
00:49:52,760 --> 00:49:54,562
I hate to break this to you,

775
00:49:54,696 --> 00:49:57,498
but if you were able
to get that vault code
out of lover boy,

776
00:49:57,632 --> 00:49:59,734
everyone would be alive
right now, including Nigel.

777
00:49:59,868 --> 00:50:01,769
- Oh, my God.
- Hmm.

778
00:50:02,637 --> 00:50:05,507
It's not like he had it
framed on his wall.

779
00:50:07,441 --> 00:50:09,443
Sounds a whole lot
like an excuse.

780
00:50:11,679 --> 00:50:13,480
You know how I feel
about excuses.

781
00:50:14,047 --> 00:50:15,282
Don't you?

782
00:50:17,519 --> 00:50:19,587
You're so fucking impossible.

783
00:50:20,387 --> 00:50:22,657
What's done is done.
Okay?

784
00:50:23,490 --> 00:50:25,727
Let's just stay focused
on the plan,

785
00:50:26,493 --> 00:50:27,896
and we can hash
all this out later

786
00:50:28,028 --> 00:50:30,163
over some piña coladas
in Mexico.

787
00:50:31,164 --> 00:50:32,700
Those are disgusting,
by the way.

788
00:50:34,101 --> 00:50:36,538
Ugh! Gets in your teeth.

789
00:50:55,455 --> 00:50:57,725
Yeah?
Hello, ma'am.

790
00:50:57,859 --> 00:51:00,695
Um, is Zeno here?

791
00:51:00,828 --> 00:51:02,730
I just need to talk
with him
for a second.

792
00:51:02,864 --> 00:51:04,264
Sorry, customers only.

793
00:51:04,398 --> 00:51:06,466
You know what?
That's actually
why I'm here.

794
00:51:06,601 --> 00:51:10,572
Um, I'm just looking
to get some work done.

795
00:51:14,609 --> 00:51:16,711
Looks like you've already
had some work done today.

796
00:51:16,844 --> 00:51:17,879
Sorry?

797
00:51:18,012 --> 00:51:20,548
Oh! My appearance.

798
00:51:20,682 --> 00:51:21,716
Uh, well,

799
00:51:22,917 --> 00:51:24,619
you should see
the other guy.

800
00:51:36,598 --> 00:51:37,632
Thank you.

801
00:51:40,434 --> 00:51:41,435
Oh.

802
00:51:41,569 --> 00:51:43,738
Thought that was
a real guy
for a second.

803
00:51:49,877 --> 00:51:51,646
Wait here.
Thank you.

804
00:52:08,428 --> 00:52:10,197
You. What's good?

805
00:52:11,866 --> 00:52:12,967
I'm good. I'm--

806
00:52:13,101 --> 00:52:14,535
Everything's good. Um...

807
00:52:14,669 --> 00:52:17,371
Uh, I was just looking
to get a tattoo.

808
00:52:17,505 --> 00:52:20,775
Fuck. What's happening
with your hand?

809
00:52:20,908 --> 00:52:22,142
Oh!

810
00:52:23,845 --> 00:52:24,946
Psoriasis.

811
00:52:25,079 --> 00:52:27,115
It's really,
really flared up
on me today.

812
00:52:27,247 --> 00:52:28,883
Yeah, all right.

813
00:52:29,017 --> 00:52:30,652
So where we working?

814
00:52:30,785 --> 00:52:32,787
Uh, yeah, just, um...

815
00:52:34,187 --> 00:52:35,623
right here.

816
00:52:35,757 --> 00:52:38,258
Damn. I like your tats.
That's good shit.

817
00:52:38,392 --> 00:52:40,128
Oh. Wow, thank you so much.

818
00:52:40,260 --> 00:52:42,930
I, uh, I like yours, too.

819
00:52:43,497 --> 00:52:45,600
So, uh, what you want?

820
00:52:45,733 --> 00:52:48,502
Well, I have
a buddy of mine, um,

821
00:52:48,636 --> 00:52:51,139
and he got this awesome tattoo.
I want the exact same one.

822
00:52:51,271 --> 00:52:54,174
I think he said
that he got it here?

823
00:52:54,307 --> 00:52:55,610
No shit.

824
00:52:55,743 --> 00:52:58,245
You know Ben?
Ben!

825
00:52:59,047 --> 00:53:00,682
Yeah.
Ben.

826
00:53:01,481 --> 00:53:04,251
So, um, did you guys
serve together?

827
00:53:04,384 --> 00:53:05,853
Yeah, we did.

828
00:53:05,987 --> 00:53:07,722
Serve together.

829
00:53:07,855 --> 00:53:09,824
Honorably.
Hmm.

830
00:53:10,424 --> 00:53:11,893
Rock on, brother.

831
00:53:14,529 --> 00:53:16,631
Hey, um, speaking of Ben,

832
00:53:16,764 --> 00:53:18,933
is he still working
at the same place?

833
00:53:19,067 --> 00:53:21,536
I don't know.
Ben doesn't talk about work.

834
00:53:21,669 --> 00:53:23,738
Classic Ben. Hates work.

835
00:53:24,172 --> 00:53:25,405
Hates it.

836
00:53:26,040 --> 00:53:27,041
Um...

837
00:53:27,175 --> 00:53:29,209
Funny story about Ben.

838
00:53:29,342 --> 00:53:31,045
Um, you know
his last name, right?

839
00:53:31,179 --> 00:53:32,446
Yeah.

840
00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:33,848
Okay.

841
00:53:33,981 --> 00:53:35,917
How would you
think it's pronounced?

842
00:53:42,890 --> 00:53:46,094
Seriously, you're gonna...
you're gonna love this.

843
00:53:46,226 --> 00:53:48,495
Just... just say his last name.

844
00:53:53,167 --> 00:53:54,669
Why don't you say it?

845
00:53:59,674 --> 00:54:01,308
Ah, you know, never mind.

846
00:54:02,777 --> 00:54:04,879
It's fine.
It's not that funny.

847
00:54:05,012 --> 00:54:06,581
Because, you know,
if you tell a bad joke,

848
00:54:06,714 --> 00:54:08,448
you have to explain it,
it's not good.

849
00:54:08,583 --> 00:54:10,017
Yeah, give me a sec.

850
00:54:10,151 --> 00:54:12,285
Mm-hmm. Yeah.
Take your time.

851
00:54:18,826 --> 00:54:19,961
You know,

852
00:54:20,094 --> 00:54:22,597
I'm thinking that
maybe you don't know Ben.

853
00:54:25,032 --> 00:54:26,466
Yo, what the fuck is this?

854
00:54:26,601 --> 00:54:28,669
I'm not gonna hurt you, okay?
Just put down the knife.

855
00:54:32,640 --> 00:54:34,976
Tell me everything you know
about Ben and I'm gone.

856
00:54:35,109 --> 00:54:36,409
Whoa!

857
00:54:38,079 --> 00:54:39,714
Shit!
Oh, no!

858
00:54:51,092 --> 00:54:53,060
I'll give you another one
for free.

859
00:54:54,629 --> 00:54:57,464
Let me show you
how it's done.

860
00:55:08,943 --> 00:55:10,545
Shit. Fuck.
Oh...

861
00:55:13,614 --> 00:55:16,017
Fuck! Ow! Shit.

862
00:55:16,483 --> 00:55:18,119
You little shit!

863
00:55:18,252 --> 00:55:19,854
Fuck you, man.

864
00:55:29,030 --> 00:55:30,665
Enough of this shit.

865
00:56:03,264 --> 00:56:05,132
What the fuck are you doing?

866
00:56:22,049 --> 00:56:23,084
Oh!

867
00:56:23,217 --> 00:56:24,986
Fuck!

868
00:56:36,731 --> 00:56:38,699
Shit! Fuck! My eyes!

869
00:56:38,833 --> 00:56:39,867
Oh, fuck!

870
00:56:40,001 --> 00:56:41,736
Oh, fuck!

871
00:56:41,869 --> 00:56:44,872
I can't see!
Okay. All right, man.

872
00:56:45,006 --> 00:56:47,375
What the fuck?
What's his name?

873
00:56:47,508 --> 00:56:49,877
Fuck you and the horse
you rode in on, man.

874
00:56:53,080 --> 00:56:54,315
Okay. Look, look.

875
00:56:54,447 --> 00:56:57,118
Please.
Please don't make me do this.

876
00:56:57,251 --> 00:56:59,287
Fucking eat shit, man.

877
00:57:00,221 --> 00:57:03,124
Okay. Okay,
this is gonna suck.
Are you sure?

878
00:57:03,257 --> 00:57:04,558
Oh, fuck off!

879
00:57:04,692 --> 00:57:06,160
Okay. Here we go.

880
00:57:06,294 --> 00:57:08,296
Fuck!

881
00:57:08,428 --> 00:57:09,864
Hey, hey,
just give me his name.

882
00:57:09,997 --> 00:57:12,199
Just give me his name.

883
00:57:12,333 --> 00:57:13,768
Oh, Jesus!

884
00:57:13,901 --> 00:57:16,170
Fuck, it's Clark!
It's Clark!
Okay. Okay.

885
00:57:16,304 --> 00:57:18,606
Clark, Ben. Ben Clark.

886
00:57:19,507 --> 00:57:21,175
There we go.
Was that so hard?

887
00:57:22,710 --> 00:57:24,412
Listen, I've given you
what you want.

888
00:57:24,545 --> 00:57:26,147
Now just fucking go.

889
00:57:26,280 --> 00:57:27,447
Just one second.
One second.

890
00:57:27,581 --> 00:57:30,184
Oh, shit.

891
00:57:30,318 --> 00:57:32,753
Hey there, Chad, it's Nate
over at San Diego Trust.

892
00:57:32,887 --> 00:57:35,189
Glad I caught you
before the holiday.

893
00:57:35,323 --> 00:57:38,092
Yeah, listen, I was hoping you
could run a quick credit check

894
00:57:38,225 --> 00:57:39,961
on a new client
whose file's incomplete.

895
00:57:40,094 --> 00:57:41,796
His name is Ben Clark.

896
00:57:41,929 --> 00:57:44,765
He did serve in the military.
Does that narrow it down?

897
00:57:46,100 --> 00:57:48,669
Yeah. Yeah, V.A. loans.
That's him.

898
00:57:48,803 --> 00:57:52,206
Um, you don't have any
employment on record, do you?

899
00:57:53,374 --> 00:57:54,909
How about
a last-known residence?

900
00:57:56,077 --> 00:57:59,647
Yeah, um, yeah,
hold on one second. Um...

901
00:58:03,317 --> 00:58:05,019
Okay, shoot.

902
00:58:06,253 --> 00:58:07,621
Okay.

903
00:58:08,122 --> 00:58:10,925
402...

904
00:58:12,660 --> 00:58:15,696
North Tower Lane.

905
00:58:15,830 --> 00:58:19,200
All right.
Chad, thank you so much, man.

906
00:58:19,333 --> 00:58:20,601
You're the best.

907
00:58:21,102 --> 00:58:22,136
Oh.

908
00:58:22,269 --> 00:58:25,573
Yeah, Merry Christmas
to you, too. Go, Padres.

909
00:59:07,381 --> 00:59:09,784
<i>Something's wrong.</i>
<i>He should definitely be here.</i>

910
00:59:09,917 --> 00:59:12,386
Look, he's got plenty of time.
We can't leave till
it's dark anyway.

911
00:59:12,521 --> 00:59:14,321
I'm gonna check his house.
The house he just spent

912
00:59:14,455 --> 00:59:16,957
all weekend booby-trapping
like he's
Wile E. fucking Coyote?

913
00:59:17,091 --> 00:59:19,460
That house?
You think he's gonna
go back there?

914
00:59:19,593 --> 00:59:20,529
Use your brain, man.

915
00:59:20,661 --> 00:59:21,762
He's my brother!

916
00:59:21,896 --> 00:59:23,097
I'm well aware of that.

917
00:59:23,230 --> 00:59:24,665
Take a half hour.
If he's not there,

918
00:59:24,799 --> 00:59:26,567
I'll come back and we can go.

919
00:59:27,601 --> 00:59:28,836
Andre.

920
00:59:29,937 --> 00:59:30,871
Andre!

921
00:59:31,005 --> 00:59:33,140
Don't be a fucking idiot!

922
01:00:29,196 --> 01:00:30,297
All right.

923
01:00:37,037 --> 01:00:40,407
Okay, so you're a prepper.

924
01:00:41,208 --> 01:00:42,309
Ew.

925
01:00:45,646 --> 01:00:47,481
Where the hell do you work?

926
01:00:54,589 --> 01:00:55,823
What?

927
01:00:56,423 --> 01:00:57,925
What is that?

928
01:01:02,597 --> 01:01:03,931
What the fuck is that?

929
01:01:05,166 --> 01:01:06,400
Why?

930
01:01:08,802 --> 01:01:10,738
Okay, uh...

931
01:01:15,644 --> 01:01:16,877
All right.

932
01:01:23,284 --> 01:01:25,219
Whoa. Hmm.

933
01:01:32,493 --> 01:01:33,827
No.

934
01:01:48,209 --> 01:01:49,343
There you are.

935
01:01:51,646 --> 01:01:52,947
Oh.

936
01:01:53,648 --> 01:01:55,349
Come on! Really?

937
01:02:02,691 --> 01:02:04,925
Crossbow under the sink.

938
01:02:05,826 --> 01:02:07,127
Of course.

939
01:02:17,137 --> 01:02:18,772
All right, whatever-- Fuck it.

940
01:02:59,380 --> 01:03:01,915
Okay. Okay.

941
01:03:10,491 --> 01:03:12,026
Yes. Yes!

942
01:03:14,428 --> 01:03:15,462
Yes.

943
01:03:17,766 --> 01:03:20,034
Okay. I found you.

944
01:03:20,167 --> 01:03:22,537
And now I'm gonna
make you wish you never--

945
01:03:22,671 --> 01:03:24,271
Oh, my God!

946
01:03:26,307 --> 01:03:27,341
What?

947
01:03:32,913 --> 01:03:34,516
What the fuck?

948
01:03:37,552 --> 01:03:38,586
Oh, fu--

949
01:03:45,459 --> 01:03:48,095
Oh, phew. Big phew.

950
01:03:49,029 --> 01:03:50,197
Okay. Um...

951
01:03:54,835 --> 01:03:57,505
<i>This better be you calling</i>
<i>from a hospital or a jail.</i>

952
01:03:57,639 --> 01:03:59,907
No, not quite. I'm at, uh,

953
01:04:00,040 --> 01:04:02,209
402 North Tower Lane
in Cortez Hill.

954
01:04:02,343 --> 01:04:04,311
I'm hanging upside-down
and I need you to come get me.

955
01:04:04,445 --> 01:04:06,413
<i>What the hell do you mean</i>
<i>you're hanging upside-down?</i>

956
01:04:06,548 --> 01:04:09,249
I mean I'm currently suspended
in some kind of snare trap,

957
01:04:09,383 --> 01:04:11,185
and if you don't come right now
and cut me down,

958
01:04:11,318 --> 01:04:13,354
then Sherry's gonna die.
I'm probably gonna die.

959
01:04:13,487 --> 01:04:14,955
<i>Dude, you can't put</i>
<i>that shit on me.</i>

960
01:04:15,089 --> 01:04:16,390
<i>I'm not getting</i>
<i>involved in this.</i>

961
01:04:16,524 --> 01:04:18,359
You already are, okay?

962
01:04:19,226 --> 01:04:21,462
Look, man, I'm sorry. I just...

963
01:04:23,832 --> 01:04:26,433
I don't know who else to call.

964
01:04:26,568 --> 01:04:29,970
Maybe to you
I'm just some random guy
you met on the Internet,

965
01:04:30,104 --> 01:04:32,973
but to me,
all that time we spent together
it actually meant something.

966
01:04:33,107 --> 01:04:34,542
You're...

967
01:04:36,176 --> 01:04:38,813
You're my only friend,
Roscoe.

968
01:04:38,946 --> 01:04:40,314
And right now,

969
01:04:41,583 --> 01:04:42,784
I need you.

970
01:04:42,916 --> 01:04:44,885
<i>Oh, goddamn it!</i>

971
01:04:45,018 --> 01:04:46,487
<i>Okay, look,</i>
<i>it says fifteen minutes,</i>

972
01:04:46,621 --> 01:04:48,455
<i>but I'll take the Harley</i>
<i>and be there in ten, all right?</i>

973
01:04:48,590 --> 01:04:51,125
Yes! Yes, thank you.
Thank you so much.

974
01:04:51,258 --> 01:04:52,660
<i>Yeah, yeah, just hang in there.</i>

975
01:04:52,794 --> 01:04:55,162
<i>Sorry, that wasn't a pun.</i>
<i>I meant it sincerely.</i>

976
01:04:55,295 --> 01:04:57,064
No, no, it was funny.
It was funny.

977
01:04:57,197 --> 01:04:58,633
Just please hurry, okay?

978
01:04:58,767 --> 01:05:00,000
<i>Yeah, okay. Bye.</i>

979
01:05:00,467 --> 01:05:02,169
Okay. Okay.

980
01:05:02,737 --> 01:05:03,971
Okay, ten minutes.

981
01:05:04,371 --> 01:05:05,406
Ten minutes.

982
01:05:06,106 --> 01:05:07,441
I can make it ten minutes.
Okay.

983
01:05:09,443 --> 01:05:10,377
Ben?

984
01:05:10,512 --> 01:05:12,413
Oh, no.

985
01:05:14,415 --> 01:05:15,916
You here, bro?

986
01:05:45,513 --> 01:05:46,947
Hi.

987
01:05:48,850 --> 01:05:50,017
Who the hell are you?

988
01:05:50,150 --> 01:05:52,085
Uh. I'm-- I'm just a thief.

989
01:05:52,219 --> 01:05:54,556
You know,
just came here to, uh...

990
01:05:56,724 --> 01:05:58,158
thieve.

991
01:05:59,126 --> 01:06:00,060
Where's my brother?

992
01:06:00,194 --> 01:06:02,262
I'm sorry, your what?

993
01:06:02,396 --> 01:06:04,431
Uh, look, man, look,
I don't know anything

994
01:06:04,566 --> 01:06:06,266
about anybody's brother. I'm--

995
01:06:06,400 --> 01:06:09,838
You know, I just randomly
picked this place and, uh,

996
01:06:09,970 --> 01:06:12,339
well, apparently,
I picked wrong.

997
01:06:12,473 --> 01:06:14,007
You know, most people
have the doorbell

998
01:06:14,141 --> 01:06:16,276
with the camera,
but an indoor snare trap?

999
01:06:16,410 --> 01:06:18,646
Egg on my face.

1000
01:06:19,581 --> 01:06:21,315
You don't look
like a thief.

1001
01:06:21,448 --> 01:06:22,550
Yeah, well,

1002
01:06:23,551 --> 01:06:25,720
the best of us rarely do.
Hmm.

1003
01:06:28,489 --> 01:06:30,758
So you just picked this place
at random, huh?

1004
01:06:30,892 --> 01:06:32,993
Yeah. Yeah, just my luck.
Yeah?

1005
01:06:33,126 --> 01:06:34,729
Then why the fuck

1006
01:06:35,697 --> 01:06:39,132
do you have his address
on your fucking hand?

1007
01:06:42,236 --> 01:06:44,104
That's such a good question.

1008
01:06:44,706 --> 01:06:45,773
And...

1009
01:06:45,907 --> 01:06:47,709
...the answer's really
gonna blow your mind.

1010
01:06:49,243 --> 01:06:52,112
Yeah, you can go ahead
and take that if you need to.

1011
01:06:53,080 --> 01:06:54,314
Yeah?

1012
01:06:55,249 --> 01:06:56,784
Look, um...

1013
01:06:59,052 --> 01:07:00,254
Ben's dead.

1014
01:07:01,188 --> 01:07:03,290
<i>Just heard it</i>
<i>over the scanner.</i>

1015
01:07:06,126 --> 01:07:08,663
Who did it? Cops?
<i>Uh, no.</i>

1016
01:07:08,796 --> 01:07:11,465
Apparently, it was just
some random Good Samaritan.

1017
01:07:12,399 --> 01:07:14,134
Skinny guy in a suit.

1018
01:07:15,770 --> 01:07:16,871
Look, um,

1019
01:07:17,639 --> 01:07:19,072
why don't you
just get back here

1020
01:07:19,206 --> 01:07:20,542
<i>and we'll</i>
<i>figure it all out?</i>

1021
01:07:22,610 --> 01:07:25,112
Did he seriously
just hang up on me?

1022
01:07:37,025 --> 01:07:38,526
Whoa, whoa, hey, hold on.

1023
01:07:38,660 --> 01:07:40,193
Hold on. Hey.
Let's just talk about this.

1024
01:07:40,327 --> 01:07:41,696
You killed my brother!

1025
01:07:41,829 --> 01:07:43,397
Look, man, I, uh...

1026
01:07:46,300 --> 01:07:48,402
I did kill him.

1027
01:07:48,536 --> 01:07:50,505
And, look, I know that means
you're gonna kill me, too,

1028
01:07:50,638 --> 01:07:53,440
but please just
do me a favor, okay? Just--

1029
01:07:54,042 --> 01:07:55,242
Just make it quick.

1030
01:07:55,375 --> 01:07:58,345
There's no need
to draw this out.

1031
01:08:02,784 --> 01:08:04,552
I got a better idea.

1032
01:08:06,888 --> 01:08:08,121
Yes!

1033
01:08:08,255 --> 01:08:11,124
You know,
when I used to do this shit

1034
01:08:11,258 --> 01:08:13,595
back in special forces...

1035
01:08:13,728 --> 01:08:14,829
Mmm.

1036
01:08:14,963 --> 01:08:17,799
...it was always to try
and get some information.

1037
01:08:17,932 --> 01:08:19,299
Mm-hmm.

1038
01:08:20,267 --> 01:08:22,369
But all that matters now...

1039
01:08:22,837 --> 01:08:23,905
is the pain.

1040
01:08:24,706 --> 01:08:27,075
Think about that.
You understand pain?

1041
01:08:27,207 --> 01:08:28,843
Yeah...
I hate it so much.

1042
01:08:32,379 --> 01:08:35,215
Oh. Oh! No! Stop it!

1043
01:08:36,884 --> 01:08:39,053
I mean, oh, fuck!

1044
01:08:39,186 --> 01:08:41,689
This is bad!

1045
01:08:41,823 --> 01:08:43,524
Goddamn it!

1046
01:08:48,730 --> 01:08:49,764
Oh, wow.

1047
01:08:51,933 --> 01:08:54,569
Oh, God,
you sadistic fuck.

1048
01:08:55,036 --> 01:08:57,739
Oh.

1049
01:08:59,507 --> 01:09:01,709
No, not the pliers.

1050
01:09:01,843 --> 01:09:03,176
Please, not the pliers.

1051
01:09:03,310 --> 01:09:05,913
I can't even imagine
what you're gonna
do with that.

1052
01:09:06,047 --> 01:09:08,248
Please. Oh!

1053
01:09:08,382 --> 01:09:09,917
This little piggy...

1054
01:09:10,384 --> 01:09:12,053
went to market.

1055
01:09:16,024 --> 01:09:18,225
God, I hate how you spend
so much time on this.

1056
01:09:19,627 --> 01:09:22,063
This little piggy...
Oh, boy.

1057
01:09:22,195 --> 01:09:24,832
This little piggy...
Uh-huh?

1058
01:09:26,134 --> 01:09:28,301
...went wee, wee,
wee, wee, wee...

1059
01:09:28,435 --> 01:09:30,170
fucking all the way home!

1060
01:09:30,303 --> 01:09:33,306
Oh, wow, that hurt!
That one hurt the most.

1061
01:09:34,441 --> 01:09:35,910
How you doing?

1062
01:09:36,744 --> 01:09:37,679
Terribly.

1063
01:09:37,812 --> 01:09:40,515
No! Please, no.

1064
01:09:41,115 --> 01:09:42,617
Whoa, all this sucks so bad.

1065
01:09:42,750 --> 01:09:44,484
Please don't do that again.

1066
01:09:48,188 --> 01:09:50,058
What?

1067
01:09:50,190 --> 01:09:51,959
<i>Where the hell are you?</i>
<i>We're leaving</i>

1068
01:09:52,093 --> 01:09:53,561
<i>in thirty minutes.</i>
<i>Get your ass back here.</i>

1069
01:09:53,695 --> 01:09:56,430
Yeah, yeah. I will wrap it up.

1070
01:10:01,669 --> 01:10:03,771
Now for my favorite part.

1071
01:10:08,475 --> 01:10:12,947
I'm gonna keep your eyes
in a jar on my mantel.

1072
01:10:14,347 --> 01:10:16,584
Oh, wait, don't do that.
No. Uh, uh...

1073
01:10:16,718 --> 01:10:18,119
Actually, don't do that.

1074
01:10:18,251 --> 01:10:19,520
Uh, hey, hey! Your brother...

1075
01:10:19,654 --> 01:10:21,388
Your brother told
me something...

1076
01:10:21,522 --> 01:10:24,592
before he died. He said, uh...

1077
01:10:24,726 --> 01:10:26,627
He said, um...

1078
01:10:26,761 --> 01:10:30,098
"Tell my brother I'm sorry."

1079
01:10:32,265 --> 01:10:33,534
"I'm sorry...

1080
01:10:34,535 --> 01:10:38,773
for that thing that happened
when we were kids."

1081
01:10:40,273 --> 01:10:42,643
And...

1082
01:10:43,578 --> 01:10:45,880
...he said, "Tell him...

1083
01:10:46,013 --> 01:10:49,884
Tell him that Mom and Dad
always loved you the most."

1084
01:10:53,420 --> 01:10:54,655
Bullshit.

1085
01:10:56,356 --> 01:10:57,792
We never met our dad.

1086
01:10:57,925 --> 01:11:00,128
Okay, I think maybe
he meant it
metaphorically.

1087
01:11:00,260 --> 01:11:02,897
Wait, no! Please, please,
please, please don't!

1088
01:11:05,767 --> 01:11:07,135
Roscoe?

1089
01:11:07,267 --> 01:11:09,003
No, it's fucking Daft Punk.

1090
01:11:09,837 --> 01:11:12,740
Of course it's me.

1091
01:11:15,042 --> 01:11:16,911
Thank God. I was...

1092
01:11:18,378 --> 01:11:20,648
Huh.
What do you mean, "huh"?

1093
01:11:20,782 --> 01:11:23,818
Uh... No, I mean, um...
it's just, uh...

1094
01:11:23,951 --> 01:11:25,620
Didn't you say...

1095
01:11:26,187 --> 01:11:27,522
that you were six-foot-five

1096
01:11:27,655 --> 01:11:29,590
and that you looked
like Jason Momoa?

1097
01:11:29,724 --> 01:11:31,893
I said I kind of look
like Jason Momoa.

1098
01:11:32,026 --> 01:11:33,426
Right.

1099
01:11:34,595 --> 01:11:36,564
He's just a very
specific-looking man.

1100
01:11:36,697 --> 01:11:39,000
How about you just say,
"Thank you for saving my life"?

1101
01:11:39,133 --> 01:11:41,869
You're totally right.
Absolutely. Sorry.

1102
01:11:44,672 --> 01:11:47,041
Oh, hey.
Thank you.

1103
01:11:48,009 --> 01:11:49,043
Okay.

1104
01:11:50,044 --> 01:11:51,378
Okay, that's enough.

1105
01:11:52,880 --> 01:11:54,314
Look, go do whatever
you got to do

1106
01:11:54,447 --> 01:11:56,050
and please stay alive.

1107
01:11:56,184 --> 01:11:57,585
I need you
to be physically able

1108
01:11:57,718 --> 01:11:58,853
to explain
all this to the cops.

1109
01:11:58,986 --> 01:12:01,823
Okay...
I will stay alive,
I promise.

1110
01:12:03,925 --> 01:12:06,561
You're gonna have to
do better than that.

1111
01:12:06,694 --> 01:12:07,595
Oh!

1112
01:12:07,728 --> 01:12:09,263
Whoa!

1113
01:12:09,396 --> 01:12:11,666
Roscoe, get something!
Right! Oh, shit. Oh.

1114
01:12:22,342 --> 01:12:24,045
You motherfuckers.
Heads up!

1115
01:12:35,189 --> 01:12:36,324
Oh, shit! Sorry.

1116
01:12:36,456 --> 01:12:38,292
It's fine.
Just get something else.

1117
01:12:39,627 --> 01:12:41,963
Fucker!

1118
01:12:46,366 --> 01:12:47,367
You bunch of--

1119
01:12:47,500 --> 01:12:49,670
Aw, shit, man!

1120
01:12:49,804 --> 01:12:51,739
Bear mace.
Yeah, more, more!

1121
01:12:54,542 --> 01:12:55,743
Yeah, more.

1122
01:12:55,877 --> 01:12:57,612
Yeah, do you like this?

1123
01:12:57,745 --> 01:12:59,113
Yeah, that's right, bi--

1124
01:12:59,247 --> 01:13:00,781
Oh, goddamn it!

1125
01:13:00,915 --> 01:13:02,449
I'm gonna kill you!

1126
01:13:02,583 --> 01:13:04,085
Whoa!

1127
01:13:18,266 --> 01:13:20,701
I'm gonna fucking rip
your fucking head off!

1128
01:13:20,835 --> 01:13:24,038
Just... die!

1129
01:13:45,326 --> 01:13:46,861
Ah, okay.

1130
01:13:52,733 --> 01:13:55,303
Good thinking with the mace.

1131
01:13:55,435 --> 01:13:57,038
Yeah.

1132
01:14:00,875 --> 01:14:01,642
Jesus!

1133
01:14:01,776 --> 01:14:04,879
Hell of a way to go.
Uh-huh.

1134
01:14:09,583 --> 01:14:11,986
What'd you set a timer for?

1135
01:14:12,119 --> 01:14:14,522
Um, it was for your...

1136
01:14:15,156 --> 01:14:17,490
for your ETA or whatever.

1137
01:14:19,694 --> 01:14:21,729
I actually should pee, though.

1138
01:14:21,862 --> 01:14:22,964
Yeah.

1139
01:14:23,431 --> 01:14:24,865
Wait, what?

1140
01:14:28,501 --> 01:14:31,005
Who the fuck
are these guys, anyway?

1141
01:14:31,471 --> 01:14:32,606
No idea.

1142
01:14:32,740 --> 01:14:34,642
Huge <i>Home Alone</i> fans,
apparently.

1143
01:14:40,514 --> 01:14:42,083
Hey, um...

1144
01:14:43,651 --> 01:14:45,753
thanks again for coming.

1145
01:14:45,886 --> 01:14:49,991
Yeah, well...
...what are friends for, right?

1146
01:14:51,926 --> 01:14:54,428
Yeah, man.
That being said...

1147
01:14:54,562 --> 01:14:56,496
I will testify against you
if need be.

1148
01:14:56,630 --> 01:14:58,833
Yeah, no, no worries.
I assumed.

1149
01:15:01,902 --> 01:15:03,304
Oh, shit. It's the cops.

1150
01:15:03,437 --> 01:15:04,739
Well, great.

1151
01:15:04,872 --> 01:15:06,607
Tell them everything.
Let them go save her.

1152
01:15:06,741 --> 01:15:08,009
No, no, no.
They're not gonna listen to me.

1153
01:15:08,142 --> 01:15:09,944
They think I'm in on this.

1154
01:15:10,077 --> 01:15:12,213
No, if I go out there,
they'll bring me
to the station.

1155
01:15:12,346 --> 01:15:14,482
And by the time
I can convince anybody
to go after Sherry,

1156
01:15:14,615 --> 01:15:15,549
she'll be dead.

1157
01:15:18,019 --> 01:15:19,020
Wait a minute.

1158
01:15:19,687 --> 01:15:21,088
I think I have an idea.

1159
01:15:21,222 --> 01:15:22,790
Your Harley--
it's still parked
out front, yeah?

1160
01:15:22,923 --> 01:15:23,958
Yeah.

1161
01:15:24,558 --> 01:15:25,793
Sort of.

1162
01:15:26,627 --> 01:15:28,029
What do you mean "sort of"?

1163
01:15:32,633 --> 01:15:34,001
Nathan Caine!

1164
01:15:34,135 --> 01:15:37,204
I need you to come out
the house with your hands up.

1165
01:15:38,973 --> 01:15:41,409
Look, don't make
this harder than
it has to be, okay?

1166
01:15:41,542 --> 01:15:43,377
This whole town's
going to shit

1167
01:15:43,512 --> 01:15:46,347
'cause the Chargers
and the Clippers
betrayed us.

1168
01:15:46,480 --> 01:15:48,482
Really? Now?

1169
01:15:48,616 --> 01:15:50,184
Seriously.
Broke our heart
for what?

1170
01:15:50,317 --> 01:15:52,453
To be second fiddle
to the Rams
and the Lakers?

1171
01:15:52,586 --> 01:15:54,355
Freeze! Freeze!

1172
01:15:54,488 --> 01:15:55,856
Hey!

1173
01:15:55,990 --> 01:15:59,026
Freeze! Freeze!
Hey, stop! Stop! Shit.

1174
01:16:11,806 --> 01:16:13,274
Wait, what is he doing?

1175
01:16:13,407 --> 01:16:14,942
I don't know.

1176
01:16:17,611 --> 01:16:18,679
Hands!

1177
01:16:18,813 --> 01:16:20,948
Let me see your hands! Hands!

1178
01:16:26,687 --> 01:16:27,822
Shit.

1179
01:16:27,955 --> 01:16:29,356
Who the hell is this guy?

1180
01:16:29,490 --> 01:16:30,691
Ha, ha, ha!

1181
01:16:30,825 --> 01:16:32,693
You've been deceived,
for I am not Nate!

1182
01:16:32,827 --> 01:16:34,628
Don't care.

1183
01:16:35,863 --> 01:16:39,233
But who you are
is somebody...

1184
01:16:39,366 --> 01:16:41,969
who's about
to go to jail.
No, no, wait, wait!

1185
01:16:42,103 --> 01:16:44,205
I can help you! I can help you!
I know where Nate's going.

1186
01:16:44,338 --> 01:16:46,040
Yeah? Start talking then.
Okay, okay,

1187
01:16:46,173 --> 01:16:48,342
but could we have
a no-kicking policy
from this point on?

1188
01:16:48,476 --> 01:16:50,311
Where is he?

1189
01:17:02,990 --> 01:17:05,192
All right, come on! Time to go!

1190
01:17:10,131 --> 01:17:12,766
Where is your jumpsuit?
I'm not doing this, Simon.

1191
01:17:13,868 --> 01:17:15,703
Not doing what?

1192
01:17:16,470 --> 01:17:17,938
It's already done.

1193
01:17:19,473 --> 01:17:21,108
Can't do it.

1194
01:17:21,543 --> 01:17:22,877
Oh, fuck off.

1195
01:17:24,546 --> 01:17:28,015
Since when did you grow
a conscience anyway?

1196
01:17:28,149 --> 01:17:30,818
I mean, what about
all the other jobs we've done?

1197
01:17:30,951 --> 01:17:32,353
We've killed
people before.
No.

1198
01:17:32,486 --> 01:17:35,489
No. You've killed people
before, Simon. You.

1199
01:17:35,624 --> 01:17:37,224
Not me. I'm not like you.

1200
01:17:40,060 --> 01:17:41,662
The thing is...

1201
01:17:41,795 --> 01:17:44,198
you're not a better person
than I am.

1202
01:17:44,899 --> 01:17:46,133
Not even a little bit.

1203
01:17:46,267 --> 01:17:48,202
'Cause you won't admit
what you are.

1204
01:17:49,370 --> 01:17:54,074
You think all this fake remorse
is gonna save your soul? Hm?

1205
01:17:55,809 --> 01:17:57,178
It's bullshit...

1206
01:17:57,311 --> 01:17:58,879
Simon.

1207
01:17:59,548 --> 01:18:01,348
...and you know it.

1208
01:18:04,185 --> 01:18:05,352
Drop the gun!

1209
01:18:06,253 --> 01:18:07,188
Oh, my God. Nate.

1210
01:18:07,321 --> 01:18:09,156
I'm not gonna
ask you again.

1211
01:18:10,457 --> 01:18:11,792
Okay.

1212
01:18:18,999 --> 01:18:20,467
You okay, Sherry?

1213
01:18:23,204 --> 01:18:24,138
Um...

1214
01:18:24,271 --> 01:18:25,640
I'm sorry,

1215
01:18:25,773 --> 01:18:27,274
who the fuck are you?

1216
01:18:28,309 --> 01:18:30,211
I'm the guy that killed
your friends.

1217
01:18:31,812 --> 01:18:33,047
So if you don't want
to wind up like them,

1218
01:18:33,180 --> 01:18:35,049
I suggest you let her go,

1219
01:18:35,182 --> 01:18:36,984
and you get the hell out
of here.

1220
01:18:38,819 --> 01:18:41,455
Oh, my God.

1221
01:18:42,557 --> 01:18:45,893
Oh, my fucking God.

1222
01:18:46,595 --> 01:18:48,996
Simon, don't.

1223
01:18:51,832 --> 01:18:55,069
You're the guy
from the bank, right?

1224
01:18:58,806 --> 01:19:00,508
Okay.

1225
01:19:00,642 --> 01:19:03,477
This is legitimately
the funniest thing
that's ever happened to me.

1226
01:19:04,478 --> 01:19:08,215
You've been tailing us
to try to save... Sherry.

1227
01:19:08,983 --> 01:19:11,118
Is that right?

1228
01:19:11,752 --> 01:19:12,920
Uh...

1229
01:19:13,053 --> 01:19:15,489
I hate to break it
to you, bud, but...

1230
01:19:17,858 --> 01:19:19,860
she's my fucking sister.

1231
01:19:24,733 --> 01:19:27,401
She played you,
man. Yeah.

1232
01:19:32,306 --> 01:19:35,543
You thought
that she had feelings for you.

1233
01:19:35,677 --> 01:19:37,911
Stop, don't. Nate, I'm...

1234
01:19:38,979 --> 01:19:40,147
<i>I'm so sorry, okay?</i>

1235
01:19:40,281 --> 01:19:42,983
I never meant
for you to... to...

1236
01:19:43,117 --> 01:19:44,753
Look, everything
that happened between us,

1237
01:19:44,885 --> 01:19:46,387
I meant it, okay?
It was real, I swear.

1238
01:19:46,521 --> 01:19:48,590
Oh, what a load of horseshit!

1239
01:19:48,723 --> 01:19:50,224
Look, man,

1240
01:19:50,357 --> 01:19:52,960
<i>you're pointing the gun</i>
<i>at the wrong bank robber, dude.</i>

1241
01:19:53,695 --> 01:19:55,929
You should be shooting her.

1242
01:19:57,097 --> 01:19:58,866
So, now listen.

1243
01:20:00,702 --> 01:20:03,270
Why don't you just
get out of here, man. Okay?

1244
01:20:03,404 --> 01:20:06,140
What are you doing?

1245
01:20:06,273 --> 01:20:08,576
Get yourself
to the urgent care,

1246
01:20:08,710 --> 01:20:10,811
and just forget all about this.

1247
01:20:10,944 --> 01:20:11,912
Simon, stop it.

1248
01:20:12,046 --> 01:20:13,480
Get over it.

1249
01:20:47,948 --> 01:20:50,017
I'll give it to you,
bank boy.

1250
01:20:50,518 --> 01:20:52,052
You can take a punch.

1251
01:20:56,390 --> 01:20:58,526
Let's see how you do...

1252
01:20:58,660 --> 01:21:00,695
...under a little pressure.

1253
01:21:00,829 --> 01:21:02,363
Perfect.

1254
01:21:08,936 --> 01:21:10,605
Simon, stop it!

1255
01:21:12,439 --> 01:21:13,874
It's not
fucking funny. Stop it!

1256
01:21:17,111 --> 01:21:18,613
Stop!

1257
01:21:21,382 --> 01:21:22,416
Stop!

1258
01:21:24,118 --> 01:21:25,787
What the hell you doing?
What are you doing?

1259
01:21:25,919 --> 01:21:26,887
Are you just gonna
crush his head?

1260
01:21:27,020 --> 01:21:28,656
Well, he started it!

1261
01:21:31,325 --> 01:21:32,259
Just go.

1262
01:21:32,393 --> 01:21:34,027
Honestly, just go!
Take the money and go!

1263
01:21:34,161 --> 01:21:35,396
I'm gonna stay with him.

1264
01:21:35,530 --> 01:21:37,766
You're gonna stay
with that guy?

1265
01:21:37,898 --> 01:21:39,299
Yeah.

1266
01:21:39,433 --> 01:21:40,635
Sherry.

1267
01:21:42,136 --> 01:21:43,404
Come on!

1268
01:21:45,807 --> 01:21:48,008
I don't even
know you anymore.

1269
01:21:51,880 --> 01:21:53,113
Fine.

1270
01:21:53,581 --> 01:21:54,516
Hmm.

1271
01:22:03,023 --> 01:22:05,325
You won't do it.
Yeah?

1272
01:22:05,459 --> 01:22:06,493
You sure?

1273
01:22:07,127 --> 01:22:08,328
Mm-hmm.

1274
01:22:13,902 --> 01:22:16,136
You know what?
You're right.

1275
01:22:16,905 --> 01:22:18,673
You don't know me anymore.

1276
01:22:28,750 --> 01:22:30,685
Got him! Moving in.

1277
01:22:33,086 --> 01:22:34,789
Hands! Hands up!

1278
01:22:35,289 --> 01:22:36,990
Get them on your head.

1279
01:22:42,396 --> 01:22:44,465
This one's cooked.
Help this guy.

1280
01:22:48,670 --> 01:22:51,238
Damn, Vespa guy was right.
He's pretty beat up.

1281
01:22:51,371 --> 01:22:54,742
Yeah, well, good thing
we're here to save his ass.

1282
01:22:56,611 --> 01:22:58,913
You're lucky that
you got such a good friend.

1283
01:22:59,046 --> 01:23:00,748
Little too chatty
for me, though.

1284
01:23:21,636 --> 01:23:24,104
Backup will be here in five.
They're still stretched thin.

1285
01:23:24,238 --> 01:23:25,874
Does that mean
I can punch out now?

1286
01:23:26,006 --> 01:23:28,242
Wanda's gonna start
<i>It's a Wonderful Life</i>
without me.

1287
01:23:28,375 --> 01:23:30,344
Yeah,
we'll just get the elves
to do your paperwork.

1288
01:23:30,477 --> 01:23:32,312
Mm-hmm. Wouldn't that
be amazing if we had--

1289
01:24:21,763 --> 01:24:23,263
Hey, hey.

1290
01:24:23,397 --> 01:24:25,499
Show me where you're hurt.

1291
01:24:28,970 --> 01:24:30,004
You're gonna be okay.

1292
01:24:30,137 --> 01:24:31,506
You just have to
get to a hospital.

1293
01:24:31,639 --> 01:24:33,373
I'm gonna take your car
and go after them.

1294
01:24:33,508 --> 01:24:35,643
Like hell!
I'm not giving you my keys.

1295
01:24:37,579 --> 01:24:39,079
Sorry.

1296
01:24:39,212 --> 01:24:40,314
Don't worry...

1297
01:24:40,447 --> 01:24:41,783
...I'm gonna make sure--

1298
01:24:46,386 --> 01:24:47,889
You're really gonna shoot me?

1299
01:24:48,022 --> 01:24:49,624
I should, asshole.

1300
01:24:50,725 --> 01:24:53,327
But I won't.
You're taking me with you.

1301
01:24:56,965 --> 01:24:58,165
Okay.

1302
01:25:07,041 --> 01:25:10,444
Uh, hey, hi.
Uh, could someone please
tell me what's going on?

1303
01:25:10,578 --> 01:25:13,380
Go, go, go!
We're gonna lose him!
Yeah, don't worry.

1304
01:25:13,982 --> 01:25:15,083
I know where he's going.

1305
01:25:15,215 --> 01:25:16,450
Where who's going?

1306
01:25:16,584 --> 01:25:17,819
Oh, we're on a high-speed
chase right now?

1307
01:25:27,260 --> 01:25:28,195
Fuck!

1308
01:25:41,208 --> 01:25:42,877
Oh, shit.

1309
01:25:49,149 --> 01:25:51,284
At this speed, you won't be
able to make any adjustments,

1310
01:25:51,418 --> 01:25:52,486
and I don't know
how you drive--

1311
01:25:52,620 --> 01:25:54,589
School bus!

1312
01:26:14,174 --> 01:26:15,510
What the fuck?

1313
01:26:16,309 --> 01:26:17,879
You again?

1314
01:26:18,012 --> 01:26:20,815
Oh, Jesus Christ.

1315
01:26:41,703 --> 01:26:43,370
- Stroller!
- Yo!

1316
01:26:43,503 --> 01:26:46,507
What the fuck is wrong
with you?

1317
01:26:47,608 --> 01:26:49,777
Jesus! Where'd you learn
to drive like this?

1318
01:26:49,911 --> 01:26:51,546
I used to boost cars.

1319
01:26:53,948 --> 01:26:55,583
What? I don't anymore!

1320
01:27:01,488 --> 01:27:03,356
Oh, I might be dying,

1321
01:27:03,490 --> 01:27:05,358
but I'm gonna
kill you first.

1322
01:27:19,907 --> 01:27:21,576
Oh, shit.

1323
01:27:23,878 --> 01:27:25,947
Fuck!

1324
01:27:32,186 --> 01:27:34,856
Oh. You fucking loser.

1325
01:27:38,926 --> 01:27:40,962
So where's
this son of a bitch going?

1326
01:27:41,095 --> 01:27:42,597
He's headed to Pier 7.

1327
01:27:43,396 --> 01:27:45,332
What for?
There's a boat waiting.

1328
01:27:45,465 --> 01:27:46,567
It was gonna take us south.

1329
01:27:46,701 --> 01:27:48,970
Taxi!
I can see, thank you!

1330
01:28:00,615 --> 01:28:02,884
Hey, slow down!
Stop! Stop!

1331
01:28:09,857 --> 01:28:11,259
You want to know
something funny?

1332
01:28:11,391 --> 01:28:13,795
If you'd have just stayed
in that bank,

1333
01:28:14,729 --> 01:28:17,031
Sherry would be right here
sitting next to me.

1334
01:28:19,867 --> 01:28:22,603
She'd be just fine.

1335
01:28:23,204 --> 01:28:24,705
But now?

1336
01:28:25,273 --> 01:28:26,439
Now...

1337
01:28:26,574 --> 01:28:28,509
I'm gonna hunt her ass down.

1338
01:28:29,177 --> 01:28:30,845
I promise you that.

1339
01:28:32,146 --> 01:28:33,380
Yeah, well...

1340
01:28:35,216 --> 01:28:36,984
if you do find Sherry...

1341
01:28:38,986 --> 01:28:40,822
I want you to tell her
something for me, okay?

1342
01:28:40,955 --> 01:28:42,290
Oh, God.

1343
01:28:44,525 --> 01:28:46,627
You are one sorry
son of a bitch.

1344
01:28:46,761 --> 01:28:49,130
You know that?

1345
01:28:51,265 --> 01:28:53,500
Yeah. I know, right?

1346
01:28:54,302 --> 01:28:55,703
It's kind of my thing.

1347
01:28:56,503 --> 01:28:58,806
Listen, I want you
to tell her...

1348
01:29:00,975 --> 01:29:03,376
...that even though we didn't
spend a lot of time together,

1349
01:29:04,411 --> 01:29:07,515
that I always felt like we...

1350
01:29:08,282 --> 01:29:10,483
could've gone...

1351
01:29:11,285 --> 01:29:12,520
What?

1352
01:29:14,387 --> 01:29:16,324
What'd you feel like?

1353
01:29:16,456 --> 01:29:18,125
What was that?

1354
01:29:18,259 --> 01:29:21,062
I can't fucking hear you.
You're mumbling. Speak up!

1355
01:29:21,195 --> 01:29:23,764
Oh, sorry.
I'll try to be a little more...

1356
01:29:23,898 --> 01:29:24,632
clear!

1357
01:31:08,970 --> 01:31:11,439
I like that you're making me
earn it, bank boy,

1358
01:31:11,572 --> 01:31:13,240
but we got to wrap this up.

1359
01:31:16,210 --> 01:31:17,611
Let's go.

1360
01:31:18,245 --> 01:31:19,479
What?

1361
01:31:19,613 --> 01:31:20,848
Fuck, I can't.

1362
01:31:20,982 --> 01:31:22,249
I can't.

1363
01:31:24,018 --> 01:31:26,520
I'm sorry, I have to go.
Wait, wait.

1364
01:31:29,890 --> 01:31:32,059
God, I hope I live
to regret this.

1365
01:31:33,561 --> 01:31:34,795
Take it.

1366
01:31:35,629 --> 01:31:38,566
That motherfucker
shot my partner.

1367
01:31:41,168 --> 01:31:42,502
Don't miss.

1368
01:31:48,309 --> 01:31:50,211
And you, out!
Oh, okay.

1369
01:31:51,579 --> 01:31:52,513
Get her to a hospital.

1370
01:31:52,646 --> 01:31:54,248
Sure. Yeah.
Go.

1371
01:31:56,050 --> 01:31:58,119
Oh! God, that's a lot
of blood. Huh.

1372
01:31:58,252 --> 01:32:00,588
At least it's not
a stick shift,
am I right?

1373
01:32:00,721 --> 01:32:02,256
Sorry. Bleeding to death.
Right.

1374
01:32:22,443 --> 01:32:23,512
Oh.

1375
01:32:30,818 --> 01:32:33,421
End of the line, bank boy.

1376
01:33:03,552 --> 01:33:05,086
You always did fight dirty.

1377
01:33:13,761 --> 01:33:15,262
Sherry!

1378
01:33:16,531 --> 01:33:17,731
Looks like I finally
found a way

1379
01:33:17,865 --> 01:33:19,633
to make you
feel something, huh?

1380
01:34:02,476 --> 01:34:05,112
It's okay. I got you.

1381
01:34:07,915 --> 01:34:09,150
Hey, asshole.

1382
01:34:09,650 --> 01:34:10,985
Feel this.

1383
01:34:25,399 --> 01:34:27,902
Nate! Hey, Nate?

1384
01:34:28,537 --> 01:34:31,238
Nate, hey. Nate.

1385
01:34:31,839 --> 01:34:33,741
- Hi.
- Hey...

1386
01:34:34,175 --> 01:34:35,276
Sherry...

1387
01:34:37,546 --> 01:34:39,046
I love you.

1388
01:34:41,348 --> 01:34:43,250
You're really cool.

1389
01:34:47,021 --> 01:34:48,789
No, no, no, no!
No, no, no, no!

1390
01:34:48,923 --> 01:34:51,192
No. Hey! Hey!

1391
01:34:51,325 --> 01:34:52,661
Nate, please.

1392
01:34:52,793 --> 01:34:54,762
Help! We're over here! Please!

1393
01:34:56,730 --> 01:34:59,634
I'm so sorry, Nate.
I'm so sorry.

1394
01:34:59,767 --> 01:35:00,868
I'm here. I'm right here.

1395
01:35:01,001 --> 01:35:02,870
I'm not going anywhere,
I promise.

1396
01:35:03,470 --> 01:35:04,405
I'm sorry.

1397
01:35:06,840 --> 01:35:08,209
I'm sorry.

1398
01:35:45,279 --> 01:35:47,314
Hey, hey, hey.

1399
01:35:47,448 --> 01:35:49,250
There he is.

1400
01:35:49,383 --> 01:35:51,318
How you feeling, bud?

1401
01:35:51,452 --> 01:35:52,520
What happened?

1402
01:35:52,654 --> 01:35:56,123
Oof. Well, you've had
some major blood loss.

1403
01:35:56,257 --> 01:35:58,392
Oh.
And a heart attack.

1404
01:35:58,526 --> 01:35:59,927
And a brain hemorrhage.

1405
01:36:00,729 --> 01:36:01,929
And third-degree burns.

1406
01:36:02,062 --> 01:36:04,031
And a lot of broken bones.

1407
01:36:04,164 --> 01:36:05,266
But you're okay now!

1408
01:36:05,399 --> 01:36:07,468
It's a Christmas miracle.

1409
01:36:08,603 --> 01:36:09,870
It's Christmas?

1410
01:36:10,004 --> 01:36:11,305
It's actually January 11th.

1411
01:36:11,438 --> 01:36:13,207
You've been in
a medically induced coma.

1412
01:36:13,340 --> 01:36:16,176
But still...
...you're alive!

1413
01:36:19,113 --> 01:36:22,016
Wait. Sherry.
Is she... is she okay?

1414
01:36:22,149 --> 01:36:24,118
Don't worry. Sherry's fine.

1415
01:36:24,586 --> 01:36:25,819
She's okay.

1416
01:36:26,655 --> 01:36:27,622
Yeesh.

1417
01:36:27,756 --> 01:36:29,658
Oh. We meet again.
Hey.

1418
01:36:29,790 --> 01:36:31,760
Hey! Look who's up.

1419
01:36:31,892 --> 01:36:32,926
Yep.

1420
01:36:33,060 --> 01:36:35,329
You look... Um...

1421
01:36:36,665 --> 01:36:37,599
brave.

1422
01:36:37,732 --> 01:36:39,066
I'm glad you're up

1423
01:36:39,199 --> 01:36:41,135
because I just came
from the courthouse.

1424
01:36:41,268 --> 01:36:43,871
You're looking at some
pretty serious charges here.

1425
01:36:44,004 --> 01:36:45,640
Manslaughter,
breaking and entering,

1426
01:36:45,774 --> 01:36:46,708
grand theft auto.

1427
01:36:46,840 --> 01:36:48,342
Yeah, those...

1428
01:36:49,176 --> 01:36:50,344
Those sound really bad.

1429
01:36:50,477 --> 01:36:51,378
Yeah, they are.

1430
01:36:51,513 --> 01:36:52,614
There's enough here
to lock you up

1431
01:36:52,747 --> 01:36:53,682
until you're twice my age.

1432
01:36:53,814 --> 01:36:54,882
Uh-huh.

1433
01:36:55,015 --> 01:36:56,551
But you did
save a cop's life.

1434
01:36:56,685 --> 01:37:00,454
And you also had some pretty
persuasive character witnesses.

1435
01:37:01,855 --> 01:37:04,693
Also, you're a white guy
who works for a bank, so...

1436
01:37:04,825 --> 01:37:06,060
the judge took it easy
on you.

1437
01:37:06,193 --> 01:37:08,395
Six months house arrest.

1438
01:37:08,530 --> 01:37:10,497
Five years probation.

1439
01:37:10,632 --> 01:37:13,067
Get a lawyer to look at that,
but it's a pretty good deal.

1440
01:37:14,736 --> 01:37:15,737
Oh.

1441
01:37:15,869 --> 01:37:18,172
Almost forgot the best part.

1442
01:37:20,174 --> 01:37:22,343
This is from Grace.

1443
01:37:24,078 --> 01:37:25,312
My daughter.

1444
01:37:31,085 --> 01:37:32,486
Take care, Nate.

1445
01:37:34,088 --> 01:37:35,456
Thank you, Detective.

1446
01:37:35,590 --> 01:37:37,091
Detective.

1447
01:37:46,233 --> 01:37:48,235
You're look--
Are you looking at the hand?

1448
01:37:48,369 --> 01:37:51,205
Oh, the hand?
Oh, you mean your burnt-up,
crisped-up hand?

1449
01:37:51,338 --> 01:37:52,406
Yeah. Yeah.

1450
01:37:52,540 --> 01:37:54,642
I mean, it's...
it's jarring, for sure.

1451
01:37:54,776 --> 01:37:55,909
Is it the worst part?

1452
01:37:56,043 --> 01:37:57,177
I just think
they shouldn't have to

1453
01:37:57,311 --> 01:37:59,647
dress it up all sexy,
like in fishnets.

1454
01:37:59,781 --> 01:38:01,115
It's a skin graft.

1455
01:38:01,248 --> 01:38:03,818
Look, I would
get a glove...
Okay.

1456
01:38:03,951 --> 01:38:05,352
...personally. Yeah.

1457
01:38:07,221 --> 01:38:08,857
<i>Prepare for pain.</i>

1458
01:38:08,989 --> 01:38:11,191
<i>This guy must</i>
<i>not know who he's dealing with.</i>

1459
01:38:11,325 --> 01:38:12,827
Okay, cast toxic cloud.

1460
01:38:12,960 --> 01:38:14,796
I'm equipping
the blackstone armor.
I'm going in.

1461
01:38:14,928 --> 01:38:16,698
<i>Oh, hey,</i>
<i>you're coming</i>
<i>on Saturday, right?</i>

1462
01:38:16,831 --> 01:38:17,832
<i>It's a big birthday for me.</i>

1463
01:38:17,965 --> 01:38:19,768
Yeah, man.
Wait, it's not...

1464
01:38:19,900 --> 01:38:21,235
it's not at a biker bar, is it?

1465
01:38:21,368 --> 01:38:23,370
<i>Aw, fuck you.</i>

1466
01:38:23,504 --> 01:38:25,807
Yeah, man, of course
I'm gonna be there.

1467
01:38:28,576 --> 01:38:30,144
Oh. Oh, shit!

1468
01:38:30,277 --> 01:38:31,780
<i>Dude, just hold it</i>
<i>for a couple more minutes.</i>

1469
01:38:31,912 --> 01:38:34,148
<i>This guy's almost dead.</i>
No, dude, it's not that.

1470
01:38:34,281 --> 01:38:36,150
I actually have to
get ready for that dinner.

1471
01:38:36,283 --> 01:38:38,686
<i>Wow. You're ditching</i>
<i>me to go on a date.</i>

1472
01:38:38,820 --> 01:38:40,889
I know, I know.
It's very cute and adorable,

1473
01:38:41,021 --> 01:38:44,158
and I will make this up
to you later. Goodbye.
<i>Wait, wait, wait--</i>

1474
01:38:47,662 --> 01:38:49,196
Hey, uh...

1475
01:38:49,329 --> 01:38:52,466
I can't believe it's been
a year since our first date.

1476
01:38:53,467 --> 01:38:54,569
I am...

1477
01:38:54,702 --> 01:38:57,104
so happy
I tried the pie.

1478
01:38:58,071 --> 01:38:59,306
Me too.

1479
01:39:00,040 --> 01:39:01,341
And, hey,
you even wore your tie.

1480
01:39:01,475 --> 01:39:03,410
Yeah. You noticed. Yeah.

1481
01:39:03,545 --> 01:39:05,312
It took the dry cleaners
a while

1482
01:39:05,446 --> 01:39:08,616
to get the blood stains out,
but, um...
you know, they managed.

1483
01:39:08,750 --> 01:39:09,751
They did a good job.

1484
01:39:09,884 --> 01:39:11,151
Oh, wait, um...

1485
01:39:11,285 --> 01:39:12,986
Sorry, I almost forgot.

1486
01:39:18,125 --> 01:39:19,993
Oh, my God.

1487
01:39:21,428 --> 01:39:23,464
You finally figured out
the ending.

1488
01:39:23,598 --> 01:39:27,468
Felt kind of weird
to have the knight
rescuing the damsel.

1489
01:39:27,602 --> 01:39:30,971
So I had them, you know,
kind of saving each other.

1490
01:39:31,940 --> 01:39:32,907
It's perfect.

1491
01:39:34,107 --> 01:39:35,543
Hey!

1492
01:39:35,677 --> 01:39:36,911
Button that shirt up!

1493
01:39:37,044 --> 01:39:38,546
This ain't no
conjugal visit, man.

1494
01:39:38,680 --> 01:39:41,381
Oh, sorry. No, this isn't like
a sex thing. This is, uh...

1495
01:39:41,516 --> 01:39:43,718
Uh-huh?
Okay, yep. Got it.

1496
01:39:43,852 --> 01:39:46,119
And I know that's not
an open flame I'm seeing.

1497
01:39:46,253 --> 01:39:47,488
Nope. It's not.

1498
01:39:48,790 --> 01:39:50,892
Sorry.

1499
01:39:51,024 --> 01:39:52,159
Don't play with me.

1500
01:39:52,292 --> 01:39:53,460
I'm not trying
to play with you, sir.

1501
01:39:53,595 --> 01:39:54,562
Just shh.

1502
01:39:54,696 --> 01:39:55,830
Is he new?

1503
01:39:55,964 --> 01:39:56,997
Uh, no.
He's intense.

1504
01:39:57,130 --> 01:39:58,398
Yeah.
He's really intense.

1505
01:39:58,533 --> 01:39:59,934
Yeah, they're strict here.
It's jail.

1506
01:40:00,067 --> 01:40:01,301
Inmate 241, time's up.

1507
01:40:01,435 --> 01:40:03,838
That's a tight
15 minutes, huh?
Yeah.

1508
01:40:03,972 --> 01:40:07,374
At least we only have to
put up with it
for another eight months.

1509
01:40:07,509 --> 01:40:10,612
Yeah, seven months, 19 days,
but who's counting?

1510
01:40:12,145 --> 01:40:13,681
Don't make me come over there!

1511
01:40:14,983 --> 01:40:15,884
You're gonna
get me in trouble.

1512
01:40:16,016 --> 01:40:17,050
I'm so sorry.

1513
01:40:17,184 --> 01:40:18,318
He's so intense.

1514
01:40:18,452 --> 01:40:20,354
I know. I got to go.
Okay.

1515
01:40:24,124 --> 01:40:26,561
I'll, uh, see you soon...

1516
01:40:27,127 --> 01:40:28,362
Novocaine.
