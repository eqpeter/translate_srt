27
00:02:14,666 --> 00:02:18,666

no signs of slowing down.

28
00:02:18,687 --> 00:02:24,687
But the only way we can
overcome them is together!

Ross was criticized
for what some called

49
00:03:02,551 --> 00:03:05,614
"an unwarranted outburst"
during a press conference.

50
00:03:06,530 --> 00:03:09,520
In fact, many blamed Ross
for the collateral damage,

51
00:03:09,541 --> 00:03:11,489
believing it was his
relentless pursuit

52
00:03:11,509 --> 00:03:13,676
of Banner's Hulk
that led to the rampage.

53
00:03:14,447 --> 00:03:16,489
It also resulted in

But in a surprising turn

he managed to
shift the narrative,

58
00:03:24,583 --> 00:03:26,561

00:28:38,614 --> 00:28:41,593
-We don't know what happened.
-Enough.

537
00:28:43,635 --> 00:28:44,603
What do we know?

538
00:28:45,478 --> 00:28:45,687
There were five shooters.

539
00:28:46,457 --> 00:28:47,645
Isaiah was one of them.

540
00:28:47,666 --> 00:28:49,687
As was Secret Service
and active military.

541
00:28:50,457 --> 00:28:52,593
This was a coordinated
terrorist attack, sir.

542
00:28:52,614 --> 00:28:53,614
[sighs]

543
00:28:58,583 --> 00:28:59,583
What else do you have?

544
00:29:00,468 --> 00:29:01,541
The song
that preceded the shooting,

545
00:29:01,561 --> 00:29:03,489
we think it was a cue
for the attack.

546
00:29:03,509 --> 00:29:05,457
Sir, Isaiah looked like
he wasn't in control.

547
00:29:05,478 --> 00:29:06,624
He had no idea where he was.

548
00:29:06,645 --> 00:29:08,583
So you're suggesting what?

549
00:29:08,603 --> 00:29:09,655
[Sam] Let me investigate.

550
00:29:09,676 --> 00:29:10,666
[scoffs]

551
00:29:10,687 --> 00:29:13,499
Don't you think you're
a little too close to this?

552
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:15,520
Sir, your inner circle
has been compromised.

553
00:29:15,541 --> 00:29:17,561
There's possibility
of another attack now.

554
00:29:17,583 --> 00:29:19,457
And what exactly
do you have to offer

555
00:29:19,478 --> 00:29:21,676
that our entire intelligence
and defense apparatus can't?

556
00:29:22,447 --> 00:29:23,583
Well, I won't sit around
and let Isaiah...

557
00:29:23,603 --> 00:29:27,499
Look, I know how important
Bradley is to you.

558
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:29,478
But consider the optics.

559
00:29:30,551 --> 00:29:33,666
Captain America conducts
a personal investigation

560
00:29:33,687 --> 00:29:37,603
of a friend who tried
to assassinate the President.

561
00:29:37,624 --> 00:29:40,614
Isaiah sacrificed everything
for this country.

562
00:29:40,635 --> 00:29:42,687
He's a soldier. A patriot.

563
00:29:43,457 --> 00:29:44,551
He had no reason to do this.

564
00:29:44,572 --> 00:29:46,520
He had every reason.

565
00:29:46,541 --> 00:29:48,614
Bradley was in prison
for rescuing his own men,

566
00:29:48,635 --> 00:29:51,489
experimented on for 30 years.

567
00:29:51,509 --> 00:29:53,655
The things done to him are
enough to make anyone snap.

568
00:29:54,593 --> 00:29:56,593
Sir, you invited me here
to work together.

569
00:29:56,614 --> 00:29:59,561
-So let's work together.
-I'm afraid that offer expired

570
00:29:59,583 --> 00:30:01,530
when your friend tried
to kill me.

[Ross sighs]

572
00:30:06,478 --> 00:30:10,572
Sam, you shouldn't even be
in these situations.

573
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:14,468
You're not Steve Rogers.

574
00:30:16,624 --> 00:30:17,655
Ruth,

575
00:30:17,676 --> 00:30:20,530
you have my full authority
to put this thing to bed.

576
00:30:21,530 --> 00:30:23,666
Before this treaty
gets compromised any further.

577
00:30:27,561 --> 00:30:28,561
So that's it?

578
00:30:29,645 --> 00:30:30,645
I'm done?

579
00:30:31,561 --> 00:30:32,603
You're done.

580
00:30:32,624 --> 00:30:34,624
This is bullshit,
and you know it.

581
00:30:34,645 --> 00:30:36,489
This is politics.

582
00:30:36,676 --> 00:30:38,666
So you better wise up, son.

583
00:30:41,499 --> 00:30:42,666
"Son." Who you calling "son"?

584
00:30:42,687 --> 00:30:44,655
Sam. What the hell
are you doing?

585
00:30:44,676 --> 00:30:46,468
I'm going to clear Isaiah.

586
00:30:46,489 --> 00:30:47,624
Storming in there
ain't gonna help him.

587
00:30:47,645 --> 00:30:49,635
-You need Ross on your side.
-Ross?

588
00:30:50,530 --> 00:30:51,593
Open your eyes.

589
00:30:51,614 --> 00:30:53,489
I offer to help,
and he sends me packin'.

590
00:30:53,509 --> 00:30:55,687
Ross is on his own side.
He always has been.

591
00:30:56,457 --> 00:30:58,468
Either you can't see that,
or you don't want to.

592
00:30:58,489 --> 00:30:59,447
Hey.

593
00:31:00,478 --> 00:31:01,489
Don't be that guy.

594
00:31:01,509 --> 00:31:02,676
And what guy is that?

595
00:31:03,447 --> 00:31:04,593
The one who has to do it
the hard way.

596
00:31:10,676 --> 00:31:12,614

Tell me you didn't

Of course I didn't.

I don't know.

616

You gotta give me more
than "I don't know."

Is there anything
you remember?

picked my suit up at

took our photo.

But my phone was on the fritz.

623
00:32:55,457 --> 00:32:58,614
And then, we went over

[Joaquin] I think I committed
treason and espionage,

650
00:34:33,572 --> 00:34:36,635
but I made it into
the White House's CCTV system.

What am I lookin' for?

[Sam] When Isaiah went off
in the White House,

it made me think
of a friend of mine.

He was being controlled

Do you see any strangers
talkin' to Isaiah?

[Joaquin] No, well,
we got there, took a picture,

I AirDropped it to him,
but nothin' crazy.

never showed.

And what if they wanted us
at the White House?

survived the grenade,

you'd try to talk me down.

00:46:33,520 --> 00:46:36,530
Only way to help Isaiah is to
figure out who's behind this.

892
00:46:36,551 --> 00:46:37,666
And whoever is behind it,

893
00:46:38,572 --> 00:46:40,561
they do not want
us getting closer.

894
00:46:42,583 --> 00:46:45,520

895
00:46:46,499 --> 00:46:47,478

896
00:46:47,603 --> 00:46:48,603
What's happening?

897
00:46:48,624 --> 00:46:51,561
[Cooper] Mr. President,
as a precautionary measure,

898
00:46:51,583 --> 00:46:53,457
I have moved the prisoner to--

899
00:46:53,478 --> 00:46:54,478
[gunshot]

900
00:46:55,447 --> 00:46:59,489
President Ross,
I miss our little visits.

901
00:46:59,614 --> 00:47:00,655
Tell me something.

902
00:47:00,676 --> 00:47:03,509
Do you ever stop
to ask yourself

903
00:47:03,530 --> 00:47:04,666
who's playing the music?

904
00:47:04,687 --> 00:47:06,489
It's you.

905
00:47:06,645 --> 00:47:08,530
The White House,

906
00:47:08,551 --> 00:47:09,655
the assassination attempt.

907
00:47:09,676 --> 00:47:11,655
That's a way of putting it.

908
00:47:11,676 --> 00:47:14,687
I helped you more
than anyone else.

909
00:47:15,457 --> 00:47:16,593
Only to get what you want.

910
00:47:16,614 --> 00:47:17,614
What do you want?

911
00:47:17,635 --> 00:47:21,541
I wanted my life back, but
it's too late for that now.

912
00:47:21,561 --> 00:47:22,603
You've gotta--

913
00:47:22,624 --> 00:47:24,624
You gotta understand
my position.

914
00:47:24,645 --> 00:47:26,593
-I...
-Oh, I do.

915
00:47:27,468 --> 00:47:30,520
You let me rot in this prison.

916
00:47:30,541 --> 00:47:32,635
And it was my curse
to watch your betrayal

917
00:47:32,655 --> 00:47:34,603
written in probabilities.

918
00:47:35,614 --> 00:47:38,572
I'm making my own choices now.

919
00:47:38,593 --> 00:47:41,447
So many surprises left.

920
00:47:41,468 --> 00:47:42,468
When I'm done,

921
00:47:42,489 --> 00:47:45,478
everyone will know
just who you are,

922
00:47:45,499 --> 00:47:48,499
and Betty will despise you
even more.

923
00:47:49,468 --> 00:47:50,551
Goodbye, Mr. President.

924
00:47:54,478 --> 00:47:55,530
[Isaiah] The hell is going on?

925
00:47:55,666 --> 00:47:57,572
I'm putting you in solitary.

926
00:47:57,593 --> 00:47:58,593
Yeah.

927
00:47:59,468 --> 00:48:01,561
Nobody's gonna put me
in solitary ever again.

928
00:48:01,583 --> 00:48:02,666
It's for your protection.

929
00:48:03,624 --> 00:48:06,624
I'll tell you this one more
time for your protection,

930
00:48:06,645 --> 00:48:09,551
I ain't goin'
in a box ever again.

931
00:48:10,551 --> 00:48:12,635
I won't be able to
guarantee your safety.

932
00:48:12,655 --> 00:48:14,645
Safety ain't all
it's cracked up to be.

933
00:48:16,509 --> 00:48:17,468
You still think

934
00:48:17,489 --> 00:48:18,593
I had somethin'
to do with all of this?

935
00:48:19,593 --> 00:48:20,572
I don't know.

936
00:48:20,593 --> 00:48:21,624

937
00:48:26,645 --> 00:48:27,603

00:48:27,624 --> 00:48:29,572
[Ross] I need you
to drop whatever you're doin'.

939
00:48:29,593 --> 00:48:31,499
Camp Echo One's
been compromised.

940
00:48:31,655 --> 00:48:33,447
Yes, Mr. President.

941
00:49:00,666 --> 00:49:01,666
This is it.

942
00:49:02,624 --> 00:49:03,655
Camp Echo One.

We gotta see
what's underneath.

946
00:49:13,676 --> 00:49:15,666
[Sam]
We've got cameras and guards.

947

Redwing, cut the fence
and go loop the feed.

948
00:49:23,593 --> 00:49:26,666
Yeah, we got a 28-second
window to get past the guards.

949
00:49:26,687 --> 00:49:28,614
We gotta do the door manually.

00:49:33,541 --> 00:49:34,499

[Sam] Why is there a lab
in this prison?

00:51:40,655 --> 00:51:42,520
What the hell is this place?

965
00:52:55,468 --> 00:52:56,572
What the hell?

966
00:53:03,583 --> 00:53:04,583
[Ross] Ozaki-san,

967
00:53:04,603 --> 00:53:06,468
I want to assure you

968
00:53:06,489 --> 00:53:09,520
America remains committed
to sharing our adamantium

969
00:53:09,541 --> 00:53:11,499
with the rest of the world.

970
00:53:11,520 --> 00:53:14,603
I trust Japan shares
that commitment.

971
00:53:15,489 --> 00:53:17,468
The world needs this treaty.

972
00:53:20,572 --> 00:53:22,551
Diplomacy must be hard
for you

973
00:53:23,499 --> 00:53:24,645
A man in a country

974
00:53:24,666 --> 00:53:27,530
so used to taking
whatever he wants by force.

975
00:53:28,447 --> 00:53:29,551
Excuse me?

976
00:53:29,572 --> 00:53:31,676
How else to explain your theft
of our adamantium,

977
00:53:32,447 --> 00:53:35,468
only to return it to us
in Washington.

978
00:53:35,593 --> 00:53:38,593
What you're accusing us of
is baseless

979
00:53:38,614 --> 00:53:40,635
and insulting.

980
00:53:40,655 --> 00:53:44,561
So, the information
my intelligence team received

981
00:53:44,583 --> 00:53:45,687
and verified

982
00:53:46,457 --> 00:53:47,635
is incorrect?

983
00:53:52,666 --> 00:53:54,468
[chuckles] Wh--

984
00:53:57,687 --> 00:53:59,499
[Ross sighs]

985
00:54:00,489 --> 00:54:01,489
I'm a fool.

986
00:54:03,541 --> 00:54:06,655
I'm a fool to negotiate
with someone so naive

987
00:54:06,676 --> 00:54:09,530
they don't realize
they're being played.

988
00:54:10,499 --> 00:54:11,499
Naive?

989
00:54:12,603 --> 00:54:14,541
If I'd stolen the sample,

990
00:54:14,676 --> 00:54:18,635
why would I order Captain
America to retrieve it?

991
00:54:18,655 --> 00:54:21,583
I suppose
we'll never know the truth.

992
00:54:27,614 --> 00:54:30,624
Whatever game you're playing,
Japan wants no part in it.

993
00:54:31,583 --> 00:54:33,499
Don't test us, Mr. President.

994
00:54:40,603 --> 00:54:42,645
He's got optogenetic data
on a lot of people.

995
00:54:43,583 --> 00:54:45,551
Don't make me look up words,
Joaquin.

996
00:54:45,572 --> 00:54:47,499
I think he's figured out a way
to plant commands

997
00:54:47,520 --> 00:54:48,520
into people's subconscious

998
00:54:48,541 --> 00:54:50,447

999
00:54:50,583 --> 00:54:53,478
This "Mr. Blue" song seems
to be some kind of trigger.

Mind control.

1001
00:54:55,457 --> 00:54:56,457
Yeah.

1002
00:54:56,478 --> 00:54:57,635
That explains Isaiah.

1003
00:55:03,666 --> 00:55:05,645
And that's more important.

1004
00:55:06,530 --> 00:55:07,530
Take risks.

1005
00:55:07,687 --> 00:55:10,520

an awful lot to surprise me.

[door buzzes]

1010
00:55:28,530 --> 00:55:31,593
There was an 89% chance
you'd turn around

1011
00:55:31,614 --> 00:55:33,676
if I put Isaiah Bradley
at risk,

1012
00:55:34,655 --> 00:55:36,624
yet here you stand.

1013
00:55:38,509 --> 00:55:39,530
You're the buyer.

1014
00:55:39,551 --> 00:55:40,551
Indeed.

1015
00:55:40,572 --> 00:55:43,457
Hiring SERPENT was
a necessary step

1016
00:55:43,478 --> 00:55:46,499
to create a chain
of statistical certainties.

1017
00:55:46,520 --> 00:55:48,478
Maybe you're not as smart
as you think you are.

1018
00:55:48,687 --> 00:55:51,478
I am, actually.

1019
00:55:51,499 --> 00:55:54,447
My mind sees it all,
every probable outcome.

1020
00:55:54,666 --> 00:55:57,645
So you hire SERPENT
to steal the adamantium,

1021
00:55:57,666 --> 00:56:00,499
shoot up Ross' summit
announcing it

1022
00:56:00,520 --> 00:56:02,541
and now you're just
sitting here, waiting.

1023
00:56:03,530 --> 00:56:05,457
Why do you wanna kill Ross?

1024
00:56:05,478 --> 00:56:09,447
Why does everyone think that
I wanna kill Ross?

1025
00:56:09,572 --> 00:56:13,572
Is it because he imprisoned me
here without a trial

1026
00:56:13,593 --> 00:56:16,530
after an infusion of gamma
warped the structure

1027
00:56:16,551 --> 00:56:17,551

1028
00:56:21,572 --> 00:56:23,509
Damn.

1029
00:56:23,530 --> 00:56:26,468
Once Ross discovered
how useful I could be,

1030
00:56:26,489 --> 00:56:29,499
he kept me here for 16 years,

1031
00:56:29,520 --> 00:56:32,468
turning my mind
to solving his problems.

1032
00:56:32,572 --> 00:56:35,687
My solutions brought him the
highest office in the country.

1033
00:56:37,603 --> 00:56:40,676
If I wanted Ross dead,
he'd be dead.

1034
00:56:41,603 --> 00:56:43,447
Well, whatever you're doing,

1035
00:56:43,572 --> 00:56:46,541
you're hurting a lot of
people, including my friend.

1036
00:56:46,561 --> 00:56:49,499
So this is the last chance
I'm gonna give you to stop it.

1037
00:56:49,520 --> 00:56:51,489
Why are you protecting him?

1038
00:56:51,593 --> 00:56:54,520
Ross knows I'm responsible
for the White House,

1039
00:56:54,541 --> 00:56:57,509
yet he's still letting Isaiah
sit in prison for it.

1040
00:56:57,530 --> 00:56:58,624
You know he'll never change.

1041
00:56:59,530 --> 00:57:00,572
Let me finish my work.

1042
00:57:00,593 --> 00:57:02,457

Okay. I love you.

[reporters chattering]

1589
01:27:58,603 --> 01:27:59,624
Please.

1590
01:28:00,645 --> 01:28:02,499
Good afternoon, everyone.

1591
01:28:05,593 --> 01:28:07,457
When I took office,

1592
01:28:07,478 --> 01:28:12,541
I promised we would create
a true, lasting peace.

1593
01:28:13,561 --> 01:28:17,603
Today, we begin
to realize that promise.

1594
01:28:19,489 --> 01:28:20,624
[Sterns] Captain America...

1595
01:28:23,614 --> 01:28:24,687
would you do me the kindness

1596
01:28:25,457 --> 01:28:29,520
of counseling a bitter man
at the end of his rope?

1597
01:28:29,541 --> 01:28:31,468
That's what you do, isn't it?

1598
01:28:32,541 --> 01:28:33,583
Guess we have five minutes

1599
01:28:33,603 --> 01:28:35,614
until the MPs drag your ass
outta here.

1600
01:28:35,635 --> 01:28:39,489
You ruined my grand finale
on the Indian Ocean.

1601
01:28:39,509 --> 01:28:41,509
So now I'm forced
to turn myself in

1602
01:28:41,530 --> 01:28:42,530
to get what I want.

1603
01:28:42,551 --> 01:28:44,614
Well, if you're waitin'
for an apology,

1604
01:28:44,635 --> 01:28:46,447
we'll be here awhile.

1605
01:28:46,468 --> 01:28:47,666
I'm waiting for you to realize

1606
01:28:47,687 --> 01:28:49,687
that we both want
the same thing,

1607
01:28:50,561 --> 01:28:52,645
for the world to see Ross
as he truly is.

1608
01:28:53,551 --> 01:28:58,457
I'm proud to say our treaty
will finally be signed.

1609
01:28:58,583 --> 01:29:00,499
I'll take a couple questions.

1610
01:29:00,635 --> 01:29:02,489
Sir, what do you say
to reports

1611
01:29:02,509 --> 01:29:03,687
that relations with Japan
broke down

1612
01:29:04,457 --> 01:29:05,447
over your handling

1613
01:29:05,468 --> 01:29:06,635
of the White House
assassination attempt?

1614
01:29:06,655 --> 01:29:09,603
Despite fabrications
that some have used

1615
01:29:09,624 --> 01:29:11,561
to turn us against each other,

1616
01:29:11,583 --> 01:29:14,593
our bonds have proved strong.

1617
01:29:14,614 --> 01:29:17,447
You kept Ross alive for years.

1618
01:29:17,655 --> 01:29:20,583
Didn't kill him when you had
the chance at the White House.

1619
01:29:21,645 --> 01:29:23,520
The way I see it,

1620
01:29:24,572 --> 01:29:27,593
the Indian Ocean
wasn't about starting a war.

1621
01:29:28,687 --> 01:29:30,645
You wanted to
destroy his legacy.

1622
01:29:31,655 --> 01:29:33,447
Yes.

1623
01:29:34,572 --> 01:29:36,520
But you haven't
figured out how.

1624
01:29:36,541 --> 01:29:37,676
The pills.

1625
01:29:38,447 --> 01:29:39,551
I got somebody on that, too.

1626
01:29:40,489 --> 01:29:41,614
Not anymore, you don't.

1627
01:29:42,583 --> 01:29:44,593
Is it true hostilities
in the Indian Ocean

1628
01:29:44,614 --> 01:29:46,593
occurred because
the Japanese discovered

1629
01:29:46,614 --> 01:29:48,499
it was, in fact,
your government

1630
01:29:48,520 --> 01:29:50,478
who paid for the SERPENT
mercenary group

1631
01:29:50,499 --> 01:29:51,645
to steal their adamantium?

1632
01:29:52,645 --> 01:29:54,541
We did not pay them.

1633
01:29:54,561 --> 01:29:56,530
Ross turned me into a monster.

1634
01:29:56,655 --> 01:29:59,603
It's only right that I do
the same thing to him.

1635
01:30:00,614 --> 01:30:01,676
Why aren't you smiling?

1636

-On the ground!
-Hold it!

1637
01:30:09,603 --> 01:30:11,509
You ever use
that big brain of yours

1638
01:30:11,530 --> 01:30:14,530
to consider that maybe
you're wrong about Ross?

1639

1640
01:30:15,687 --> 01:30:16,655
[Captain America] Yeah.

1641

-Where are you going?
-To stop this.

1642

Get on the ground, now.

1643

to remain silent...

promised him a pardon

What do you want?

1655

[Sterns]
I wanted my life back,

for that now.

Right this way.

1763
01:41:59,530 --> 01:42:03,489
Mr. President.
How're your digs?

1764
01:42:10,666 --> 01:42:12,645
Intentionally uncomfortable.

1765
01:42:14,520 --> 01:42:16,530

hasn't got any better either.

1766

-You heard right.

1768
01:42:20,551 --> 01:42:21,520
Yes, sir.

1769
01:42:21,635 --> 01:42:22,666
That's good.

1770
01:42:23,541 --> 01:42:25,541
Mr. President,
about your blood work.

1771
01:42:25,561 --> 01:42:27,676
It seems Sterns raised
the level of gamma

1772

1773
01:42:30,447 --> 01:42:32,572
It built up in your body
over the years.

1774
01:42:32,593 --> 01:42:33,551
That led to your...

1775
01:42:33,572 --> 01:42:35,468
Led to my little tantrum.

1776
01:42:35,603 --> 01:42:37,603
Which is why I have to be
in here.

1777
01:42:39,655 --> 01:42:41,676
Good solid walls, these.

1778
01:42:42,447 --> 01:42:43,468
Yeah.

1779
01:42:43,645 --> 01:42:44,676
But I have to say,

1780
01:42:45,551 --> 01:42:46,593
it wasn't nothin' to see you

1781
01:42:46,614 --> 01:42:49,551
take full responsibility
for your actions.

1782
01:42:50,468 --> 01:42:54,457
Give up your office.
Accept your sentence.

1783
01:42:54,478 --> 01:42:56,478
I had to let the country
move on.

1784
01:42:57,541 --> 01:42:59,593
Japan decided to uphold
the treaty, by the way.

1785

Sam, why are you here?

1789
01:43:08,635 --> 01:43:09,635
[Sam] Sir?

1790
01:43:11,614 --> 01:43:13,572
We were on different sides
of this thing

1791
01:43:13,593 --> 01:43:14,666
every step of the way.

1792
01:43:16,635 --> 01:43:18,603
Look, if we can't see
the good in each other,

1793
01:43:20,447 --> 01:43:21,551
we've already lost the fight.

1794
01:43:23,489 --> 01:43:26,541
Besides, I wanted to make sure
an old soldier was okay.

1795
01:43:28,676 --> 01:43:32,551
I'd love to stay, but looks
like you have another visitor.

1796
01:43:41,603 --> 01:43:42,645
Hi, Dad.

1797
01:43:46,635 --> 01:43:50,457
I guess I have to give you
a raincheck on that walk.

1798
01:43:51,561 --> 01:43:52,603
It's all right.

1799
01:43:54,614 --> 01:43:56,687
We could just sit and talk
for a little while.

1800
01:43:59,447 --> 01:44:00,499
I'd like that.

He's still a little out of it
but doin' better.

1804

catch up.

Hey, where you headed?
Back to Baltimore?

1806
01:44:26,572 --> 01:44:27,572
No.

1807
01:44:28,530 --> 01:44:31,572
I got Ruth and me tickets
for tonight's game, courtside.

1808
01:44:32,457 --> 01:44:34,499
It's the least I could do
for gettin' me out.

I'm happy you found a friend

It weighs on you.

1831
01:45:46,666 --> 01:45:49,541
Makes you wonder
if you'll ever just be...

1832
01:45:51,541 --> 01:45:52,603

I only ever got
to see heroes online.
